"""The note connections rail: when it is on screen, and what it is made of.

WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D2: "a note's page has a connections rail (backlinks, links,
related) that is always visible on desktop and a sheet on phone", and
`GET /resurface/near` had no place to be read beside a note. The rail is the
right-hand column of the Notes tab at 1280px and wider, for the note that is
open (being edited, expanded, jumped to) or selected (the list's focused row);
below 1280 it is not drawn and the card menu's Connections sheet is the way
in, as it was. Dismissing it is remembered.

The suite cannot lay the page out, so this holds the rule as text in the three
places it lives (the markup, the script, the stylesheet), which have to agree
on one number; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/notesrail.js` measures it at 1440, 1280,
1024 and 390.
