"""An explicit window holds the notes that sit in it (TIMELINE_PLAN section 9).

The calendar asks `/timeline` for one month, week or day with `start` and
`end`. A note sits on the date it mentions where it has one, so a window is
answered by that placement, not by when the note was typed: the calendar
sweep found a day page written in March and titled for today on the feed's
today and missing from the calendar's.
