"""Help text carries emphasis: hotkeys, places and control names (INBOX 520).

The owner: "key characters or hotkeys or item/location names should be in like
inline codeblocks or bolded/italicised in the help text". The topics are the
model's only source of facts, so they stay plain text and the page decorates
its own copy at draw time (`helpEmphasis` in settings-find.js): a hotkey is a
`kbd`, a place a `strong`, a control name a `code` chip. The tokenizer is pure,
so it runs here in node; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/helpsearch.js` measures the DOM.
