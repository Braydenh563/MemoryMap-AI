"""INBOX 716: resetting a mind map topic's size.

The owner double-clicked a hand-resized topic's grip and the line did not
follow, then moved the node and the manual size came back. The server log was
`[HTTP 422] PUT /whiteboard/objects/57: Check the height and try again.`
followed by `object 57 is stale: reloading the board`: the reset wrote
`height: null`, the schema (`WhiteboardObjectBase.height`) has no null, the
save was refused, the board reloaded from the server, and the server still had
the manual size.

Two halves, because the suite cannot open a board: the schema's side is
pinned here with real requests, and the frontend's side is pinned as text.
