"""The flaw-class lints of WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 10, F4 and F7.

F4: a broad `except Exception` that says nothing turns a fault into silence.
The rule is ruff's BLE001, enabled in `pyproject.toml` on 2026-09-26 once the
33 findings were triaged (twelve were silent and now log with `exc_info`, the
rest carry a `# noqa: BLE001  # <reason>`). This file holds the switch on, so
removing it from `select` is a failing test rather than a quiet regression.

F7: threads in many modules share SQLAlchemy sessions created per call, and
nothing enforces that a thread opens its own. The plan's end state is
`Thread(` in `core/jobs.py` only (B2's job runtime); until the rest move onto
the pool, this is a ratchet: the modules that start threads today are listed
with their count, a new module fails, and a count may only go down. A thread
also runs without the request's context, so it never holds a vault grant
(`core/vault.py`), which is one more reason each one is written down.
