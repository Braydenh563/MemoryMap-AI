"""The job queue's back-pressure (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 19.5).

Measured 2026-10-05 with a model lane held busy and 2,000 captions queued
behind it (a folder of pictures dropped at once): enqueueing never blocks,
costs 53 microseconds a job, and a queued job holds 484 bytes
(tracemalloc), so neither needs a bound. What did not hold was the panel:
`pending()` returned one row per queued job, so every `/tasks` poll (every
few seconds while anything runs) carried 2,000 rows, 347 KB of JSON,
for a panel that can show a handful. The queue is now reported as the jobs
running, the next few waiting of each kind, and one row per kind saying how
many more wait, so the poll's size is bounded by the number of kinds rather
than by how many files somebody dropped.
