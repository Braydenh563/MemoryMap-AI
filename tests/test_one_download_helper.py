"""One way to hand the person a file (audit 2026-10-05, FE-16).

The hidden-anchor download (`URL.createObjectURL`, `a.download = ...`,
`a.click()`) was written out in four files, and each copy did nothing in the
desktop window, which swallows the click (skills.js's "saving a generated
file" note). `saveFile` covers both shells and `downloadBlob` is its browser
half; nothing else sets a download name.
