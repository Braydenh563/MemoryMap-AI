"""The recycle bin for documents and reminders (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 5 item 10).

Notes, boards and maps are `Entry` rows with `is_deleted`, binned and restored
by `entry/manager.py`. A document and a reminder were deleted outright, and
their Undo made a new copy with a new id: a document came back without its
history, its notes and its reminders. Now each has `deleted_at`: set, it is
in the bin; cleared, it is back with everything that pointed at it.

**Hidden everywhere by one rule, not thirty-six filters.** A binned document
must not show in the Documents list, the Library, the timeline, the graph,
search, a mention scan or the agent's tools, and those read `Document` from
fourteen modules. `core/database.py` adds `deleted_at IS NULL` to every ORM
select of the two models (the same mechanism as the space filter) unless the
session says otherwise with `including_binned`, which the bin's own routes,
a space's delete and the media sweep use: those are the readers that must
see a binned document, so that restoring one brings back its pictures and a
deleted space takes its bin with it.
