"""Tesseract runs once per page, not once per look at a page.

Reported (INBOX 314), verbatim: *"the tesseract generates it continuously not
only the first time or when prompted by the iser"*, on a scanned PDF opened in
the reading workspace.

The cause was measurable without a browser and without the binary: the
workspace fetches `GET .../ocr-regions?page=N` every time the current page
changes, and that route called `ocr.extract_regions` unconditionally. In scroll
mode an IntersectionObserver moves the current page as you scroll, so passing
over a six page scan ran the reader six times, and passing back over it ran it
six more. `core/ocr.py` says so itself: "every call re-reads the image".

Every test here counts calls into `ocr.extract_regions` against a fake that
returns a fixed answer. That is the whole measurement: the caching is what is
under test, not what Tesseract reads, and Tesseract is not installed here (see
CLAUDE.md section 4 on saying so rather than implying a reading was seen).
