"""An icon beside words sits on the words' cap-height centre (INBOX 592).

The owner, with three screenshots from Windows: "these badges and metadata
dont have their icons vertically aligned with their text, probably the case
elsewhere as well". Two rounds before this (INBOX 494, 503) measured clean in
the sandbox, whose UI font is DejaVu Sans, and wrong on the owner's Segoe UI:
a flex row centres the words' box, whose middle is the font's ascent and
descent, and Segoe's tall ascent puts that middle 0.064em above its
capitals. The corrections were per family (a chip's words trimmed to the
x-height band, fixed drops on chip and status bar icons), calibrated in the
one font nobody on Windows sees, and a trimmed chip beside an untrimmed date
put the facts line on two centres.

The recipe (DESIGN.md, "An icon beside words"): the gap is read from the live
font (`measureLabelOptics`, settings.js) into `--ph-cap-dy`; `.ph-lead` and
`.ph-trail` move by it; nobody trims a label's words or hand-sets a
`translate` on a label's icon. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/iconalign.js` measures
it (`FONT=segoe` for the owner's metrics).
