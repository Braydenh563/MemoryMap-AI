"""A board's time machine (the features audit W2; WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 33).

A board's items each have an event log (`routes_whiteboard.py`'s "the event
log for a board"): every card, drawing and object records `created`,
`edited` and `deleted` with whole field values. A note has a History sheet
that reads its log back; a board had nothing, so "what did this board look
like an hour ago" had no answer short of pressing Undo until it did, and
none at all across a reload. Three reads of that log:

- `GET /whiteboard/history`: the board's changes as moments, newest first,
  each a run of events no longer than `SESSION_SECONDS` from end to start,
  with how many items it added, changed and took away.
- `GET /whiteboard/history/{event_id}`: every item as it was straight after
  that event, in the shape `GET /whiteboard/` answers, so the board draws it.
- `POST /whiteboard/history/{event_id}/restore`: the board (or only the items
  named) put back to that moment in one transaction: rows made, changed and
  removed to match, each with its own event, so the restore is itself in the
  history and the client records it as one Undo step.

**Which items are the board's.** Every item whose events name this board
(`after.board_id`, or `before.board_id` on a delete), and every row on it now.
An item with no events at all (a duplicated board's copies, a generated or
imported map) is taken to have been there from the start, as it was now; an
item whose first event is not `created` was there before its log began, as
that event's `before` says. A library placement used to record one board
event naming no item; it records each item's `created` now
(`routes_board_library.place_library_item`), so a placed item replays like
any other. One placed before that is read as there from the start.

**Compacted history** (`events.compact`): an event older than ninety days may
have lost its values to a snapshot after it. A moment inside such a run
cannot be drawn honestly, so its preview and restore answer 410 rather than
show a board that never existed; the moment is still listed (`kept: false`).
