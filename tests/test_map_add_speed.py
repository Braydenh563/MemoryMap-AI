"""Adding a topic answers in one frame's work, not after the server and two
whole-map renders (audit FEAT-02, 2026-10-05), and the small faults the same
audit found on the add path (FEAT-15, FEAT-16).

The latency itself is measured in a browser
(`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mmdoc1005-mapaddlatency.js`, key to an editable topic
at 6, 101 and 301 topics); these pin the shape that makes it fast, so a later
change that puts the network or a second render back on the path fails here
rather than being noticed as "the map is slow again".
