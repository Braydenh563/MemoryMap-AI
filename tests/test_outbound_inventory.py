"""Every way the backend can reach the network, pinned, and none of them on by default.

The owner, 2026-10-05: "make sure it is fully local and doesn't use any
external libraries that aren't vendored". `tests/test_offline_promise.py`
pins the two opt-in switches and the copy that describes them; this pins the
code underneath: every module that can open an outbound connection, what it
talks to, and what has to happen first. A module that gains a network
library and is not in `INVENTORY` fails here until somebody has written down
where it goes and who asked for it.

The rule each row is held to: a request goes either to the person's own
configured model server (on this computer unless they typed another
address), or to a URL the person asked for, with a click or a switch that is
off out of the box. Nothing phones home by default, and the second test
proves that on a booted app rather than by reading.
