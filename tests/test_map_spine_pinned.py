"""A pinned topic's dashed box never dashes its Edge bar (INBOX 569, the
owner: "it says the edge bar is solid even though it is dashed").

`.wb-map-pinned { border-style: dashed }` came later in the file than the
bar's own `border-left: 4px solid` and at the same weight, so a dragged
topic's Solid bar drew dashed while the Shape menu said Solid. The pixels are
checked by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mmdoc1005-spinebar.js` (every Box by Edge bar
combination in three layouts); this pins the cascade that fixes it.
