"""The janitor: files a new thought into a category (LLM prompt #1).

Not a separate AI model, just a prompt to the active chat model, with
embedding-based filing behind it for when there is no model. Order of
attempts:

1. ONE call to the chat model, JSON answer. **This runs first**, which is
   the reverse of how it worked originally: the embedding shortcuts used to
   come first and were so rarely declined that in an established notebook
   the model was almost never asked, and notes were filed by resemblance
   rather than by meaning. Reported as notes landing in the wrong category
   and needing fixing by hand; see `categorise` for the full reasoning.
2. Embedding vs. category centroids: free, and what files notes when no
   chat model is running.
3. Nearest neighbours: the k most similar individual notes vote for their
   own category. Catches what a centroid can't: a category holding more
   than one kind of thing has an average resembling none of them.
4. No AI available and nothing similar → 'Uncategorised' with confidence 0.
   Saving an entry must never fail because the AI is down (plan §4).
