"""Relationship recognition with explanations (GRAPH_PLAN KG2, INBOX 528).

The auto-linker had one signal, embedding similarity, and so one reason
("similar in meaning"), and nothing at all with the embedding backend off.
A notebook says how its notes relate in more ways than their wording: two
notes that name the same rare person, two notes that both link to the same
third note, two notes that share a tag only a handful of notes carry. Each of
those is a **signal** here, with a sentence a person can check and a 0..1
confidence, and a pair's confidence is their noisy-or: independent pieces of
evidence that each might be wrong, any of which could be right.

Pure on purpose: `recognise` takes plain data, so it is tested and measured
without a database (`tests/test_relations_kg2.py`), and the route
(`routes_entries.link_suggestions`) only gathers the rows.

**Every signal's cost is bounded by a hub cap, not by the notebook.** Pairs
come from shared things (an entity, a neighbour, a tag), so a thing shared by
`n` notes makes `n²/2` pairs; past the cap it says little about any one pair
("both mention Monday") and costs the most, so it is skipped. The work is the
sum of `n²` over the things under the cap, measured at 2k and 10k notes in
the test file.

Written-close-in-time is support only: two notes typed in the same sitting
are often unrelated, so it raises a pair something else proposed and never
proposes one.
