"""Check with AI, in place (INBOX 410, the owner 2026-09-24).

"improve how the 'check with ai' feature works in the documents editor." It
used to send the document to the Chat tab with a long prompt, where a skill
suggestion that did not fit popped up over it (INBOX 413). Now it runs where
it was asked: `POST /documents/{id}/ai-check` streams one finding at a time
(the exact wording, a one-line reason, a one-line fix) into the suggestions
panel, on the documents feature's model, and says so plainly when no model is
there. The panel side is measured by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/aicheck.js`.
