"""Why two notes are linked, said from the notes themselves (INBOX 691).

The owner: "so many notes get the reason 'similar in meaning' ... needs to
be world class". `manager._deduce_reason` compares two vectors, and a vector
has no words for what it found, so every link a person did not explain read
the same four words: measured on the showcase notebook, 48 of 87 links.

The two notes usually say more than that on their face, and none of it needs
a model:

1. **One names the other**: a `[[Kiln plan]]`, or the other note's opening
   words written out in full. "“Glaze tests” names “Kiln plan”".
2. **Shared tags**, rarest first, leaving out a tag most of the notebook
   carries (it says nothing about these two). "Both tagged #schedule,
   #university".
3. **Shared named things**: a person, a place, a product. An entity both
   notes mention (`EntityMention`), or a capitalised name both write, one of
   them mid-sentence (a capital at the start of a sentence is grammar, not a
   name). "Both mention Alfa Pendular and Porto".
4. **Shared rare words**: a word only a few notes use. "Both mention “kiln”".
5. **Same category, written close together**: within a week, never
   Uncategorised. "Written two days apart, both in Travel".

The first two clues found are joined; the sentence stays under `MAX_CHARS`
(the AI audit's own cap, `ai/links.MAX_REASON_CHARS`). When none is found the
caller keeps "similar in meaning" and shows its strength in words
(`strength_word`).

Pure on purpose, and with no import from the rest of the app: `manager`
imports this, so it must import nothing that imports `manager`. The word
rules are a small copy of `ai/lexical_filing.tokens` for that reason.
