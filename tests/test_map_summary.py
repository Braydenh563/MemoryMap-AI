"""Summarise this branch (the features audit, Phase G; HISTORY's "Open:" list
after FEAT-13's first part).

`POST /whiteboard/boards/{board}/nodes/{node}/summary` writes nothing: it
reads the branch (the topic and everything under it, as an indented outline)
and hands back a few sentences, which the map puts into the topic's own note
for the person to read, change and keep (saved when the note closes, one Undo
step). With a model, the model's sentences from that outline alone; with no
model, or a reply that is not prose, the branch said plainly from its own
topics, which is never wrong and says so (`source: "outline"`). The model is a
fake transport (CLAUDE.md section 4).
