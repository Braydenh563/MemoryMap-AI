"""One attachment card for every attached file (INBOX 440 (2)).

The owner: "all of the attachment cards ui and ux and utility need a massive
redesign and upgrade." The screenshot was a note's picture in the edit form: a
white thumbnail, a bold name cut to "Gary The Moss Mons...", and three bare
glyphs under it (a sparkle, a pencil, an x) floating in empty space. Nothing
said what kind of file it was, how big, or when it came; there was no open,
no download and no rename.

Measured before the change (scratchpad/ui-sweeps/attachcards.js), one note
holding a picture and a PDF in its text and a picture, a PDF and a text file
attached to it drew **five different shapes**: an inline thumbnail with a
round x, a file card with a save button, a bare thumbnail with an x in its
corner, and two chips stretched to the thumbnail's height. The Capture box
drew the PDF twice (once as an icon-less chip, once as a file card), and the
edit form's PDF chip had no glyph at all, because its class was set without
`ph `.

So: one builder, `attachmentCard` (notes-list.js), one stylesheet block
(`.att-card`), one menu (`kebabMenu`), and the work behind the menu in a lazy
piece (attachment-actions.js), because the boot scripts were 79 bytes under
their gzip total when this started. These tests hold that shape.
