"""Magic Add and the clock (reported bug).

Reported directly: *"I just put a sentence in the magic add text box in
reminders saying 'play league of legends in half an hour' and it scheduled it
for 10am tomorrow??"*

Two separate faults, and the phrase was the smaller one.

**The timezone frame.** The route built the user's clock as `utcnow() + offset`,
which is an aware datetime TAGGED UTC that actually holds local wall-clock. The
model was therefore told "now is 2026-08-01T23:30:00+00:00" when that +00:00 was
a fiction. A model that answered with an offset of its own, the natural thing
to do, having been handed one, was then trusted and skipped the correction, so
the reminder landed out by exactly the user's UTC offset. At UTC+10 that turns
"half an hour" into ten and a half hours: 10am the next day, exactly as
reported.

**The delegation.** "in half an hour" is arithmetic, and it was being handed to
a 3B model, so the answer varied with whichever model happened to be installed.
It is resolved by rule now, before the model is consulted.
