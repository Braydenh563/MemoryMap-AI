"""The OCR workspace's controls, redesigned (INBOX 717).

The owner, 2026-10-06, with screenshots: "these arent aligned. and can you
redesign the ocr worspace controls to be more modern, professional, learnable,
accessible, usable and better ui/ux?? they also go onto two rows. the whole
ocr workspace is just a bit iffy to use and interact with", and then, after
the chat button dropped the page's whole text into the chat composer: "I
pressed the comment button on the ocr workspace and idk what just happened".

Measured before (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/ocr717.js`, 1440, a three-page PDF,
Tesseract faked ready): the head was 116px in three rows, the title row, a
36px tool row of ten controls (a Regions switch, Fit and 100%, the zoom pair,
One page and Scroll, the reader select, Read this page, a bare "all" field and
Read pages), and a 32px engine line under it ("Tesseract 5.5.3 is ready" as a
filled badge, "Reads in" and its select, Manage).

What these hold, from the markup and the code (the sweep holds the geometry):

- the tools are one `.dock` on the dock grammar (`data-dock-name="ocr"`),
  grouped View then Read, and never scroll sideways or wrap: what does not fit
  folds into the dock's own menu;
- the bare range field is gone: one filled Read split button whose menu holds
  this page, every page and a range;
- the engine's state is a dot inside the reader button, and its language and
  install live in that button's popover, not on a row of their own; Manage is
  a row of a menu;
- one '?' in the head, short;
- the chat button asks about the page with a context chip, never by writing
  the page into the composer, and says what it did;
- the rail and the reading walk with the arrow keys, and typing in a reading
  never turns the page.
