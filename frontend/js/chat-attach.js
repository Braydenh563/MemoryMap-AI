// chat-attach.js: extract notes, attaching notes and images, the attach button,

// --- extract notes (BACKLOG.md §62) ---------------------------------------------
// Select a block of writing, the Writing Room's draft, a Document's body, or
// several notes' content selected on the whiteboard, and split it into one
// or more AI-drafted notes, auto-linked with real reasons. Always a preview
// first, matching Draft AI edit's own "read it, then accept" shape: nothing
// is saved until "Save notes" is pressed, since this can silently multiply
// one piece of writing into several permanent notes.

// The last preview response, kept so commit can look up each kept note's
// server-decided category and each kept link's server-generated reason: 
// the DOM only holds what the user is allowed to edit (title, content, tags,
// keep/drop), not those.

// question and then went away, which left every turn after it ending on a blank
// box. These are the same idea for the turn you just read.
//
// Three things this must not do, all of which are why it lives out here rather
// than inside the streaming loop:
//
// - **Delay the answer.** It fires after the turn is rendered and saved, and
//   nothing awaits it.
// - **Show an error.** `/chat/followups` returns [] on every failure path
//   including the AI being off, and [] renders nothing at all. A row that says
//   "couldn't suggest anything" is worse than no row.
// - **Attach to the wrong bubble.** The reply can land after the reader has
//   sent another message or opened a different conversation, so the bubble it
//   was asked for has to still be on screen when it does.
