"""One disclosure marker (INBOX 464 (14), DESIGN.md "A disclosure marker").

Settings folds, the help accordion and task logs drew a 5x6px triangle built
from borders in `--muted` (08-consistency.css), crossed with a 2px rotated
border chevron from 07-whiteboard-misc.css; the Library's Contents, notes and
outlines drew the 16px Phosphor caret. Every fold now draws the caret.
