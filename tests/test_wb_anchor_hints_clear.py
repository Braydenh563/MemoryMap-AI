"""The link tool's anchor dots go when the link tool does (INBOX 573, the
owner: "these anchor points appeared and wont go away").

The hover listener drew a topic's eight dots under the cross-link tool and
returned early under every other tool, so after Select (V, Escape) the dots
stayed through a press on the canvas, Undo, a tab switch and the Shape menu.
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mmdoc1005-handlesleft.js` deselects five ways and counts
what is left (0/5 before, 5/5 after); these pin the four places that clear.
