"""The composer's brief for a running model (CHAT_PLAN, "the composer everywhere"
9 and 10; Phase 5 a).

The owner, 2026-10-06: "ai should still be the core when it is available, but
the composer should be used to lessen the load, refine and better the
responses and results, assist and complement, as well as cheapen the run cost
of the ai". The model still answers; what it reads is the notes cut to the
parts on the question (`composer.brief`), measured here on the 25 showcase
questions (`tests/_composer_eval.py`), and the composed answer is shown while
it writes (`/chat/stream`'s `composed_preview`).
