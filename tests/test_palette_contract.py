"""The command palette's matching stays whole and stays commands and places.

**Why this file exists.** The palette's reminder filter once read `r.content`,
and a reminder has no `content`, its field is `text`. `undefined.toLowerCase()`
threw partway through `paletteMatches` and every group was lost with it. Since
INBOX 666 the palette no longer lists content (notes, documents, reminders,
conversations, files, boards: Find anything's), so the payload half of this
file is gone; what is left keeps the same failure class out (a field read goes
through `paletteText`) and pins the new split.
