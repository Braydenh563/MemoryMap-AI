"""One editor everywhere: the lint DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 8 names.

The plan's decision is that every note editor in the app is one factory,
`noteSurface`, over the Phase 2 adapter, and that what differs between them is
size and chrome, never behaviour. A browser sweep
(`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/notesurface.js`) is what proves the engine mounts and
the toolbar, the shortcuts and the "/" menu reach it. What a sweep cannot see
is a *new* note textarea added next month with none of that, in a tab nobody
was sweeping: it renders perfectly and is simply the old editor again, which
is the whole failure this phase exists to end.

So this is the ratchet: a textarea in the page whose content is note text is in
the factory's table, or it is in the list of boxes that are deliberately not
note editors, with a reason. There is no third state.
