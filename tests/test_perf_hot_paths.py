"""The hot paths INBOX 424's audit measured, held to the shape that fixed them.

The measurement itself lives outside the suite: a CDP CPU profile at 4x
throttle on a 400-note, 1,200-link, 250-object-board, 120-topic-map fixture,
one gesture per row (the perf harness the 424 audit wrote). The suite cannot
drive a pointer through a real layout, so what it holds here is the *shape*
each number came from: every rule below is one cost that reads as ordinary
code and only shows up under a profiler. If one fails, the question is "what
does this do per frame now", not "how do I word the rule differently".
