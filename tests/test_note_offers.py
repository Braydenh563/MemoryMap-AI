"""The note editor's offers (CHAT_PLAN section 2, the note editor row):
dates become reminder offers, sums are checked, `[[links]]` are suggested
from the names other notes open with, and the filing suggestion comes with
its reason; never on quoted words; at most five. `ai/offers.py`,
`POST /read/offers`, `frontend/js/quickadd.js`."""
