"""WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I7: the evidence half of the corrections loop has a caller.

`learning.filing_evidence` was built and tested alone with nothing calling it,
the way `excluded_categories` once was (audit ARCH-08). The plan's algorithm
says the filing prompt gets the nearest already-filed notes with their
categories; the janitor's model path builds that prompt, so that is where the
evidence is read.
