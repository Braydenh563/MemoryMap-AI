"""Saying a note's sentence back to the person who wrote it (CHAT_PLAN Phase 6,
decision 33): grammar rules with a table of pairs each, no model.

- `shift_person`: the writer's "I", "my", "me" said as "you", "your",
  with the verb agreeing ("I am" is "you are", "I was" is "you were", "am I"
  is "are you", "I've" is "you have"); "Sam and I" is "you and Sam"; "we",
  "us" and "our" stay (the person was one of several). Never inside someone
  else's words: text in quotation marks, or after "Sam said:", is theirs.
- `past_plan`: a plan whose day has gone by, said in the past ("you plan to
  go" is "you planned to go"), the note's own words one tap away.
- `relative_day`: a day said against today ("yesterday", "on Friday", "last
  week", "two weeks ago", "on 3 March", "on 3 March 2025").
- `count_noun`, `join_items`, `after_comma`, `cut_title`: number agreement,
  a list said as one sentence, the case after a joining comma, a title cut
  at a word.

- `protected`, `opener`, `wording`, `variety`: the variety floor (decision
  51). A composed answer is parts; the protected ones (a quote, a title, a
  measured value, the asked words, a Help sentence) never vary, the rest
  (openers and joins) vary by chat and turn. `VARIETY_FLOOR` of
  `VARIETY_TURNS` turns of one question open differently, measured on every
  build by `tests/test_realise.py` in both voices and the help register.

Each rule is a table of input and output pairs in `tests/test_realise.py`;
a rule that would change what a sentence means has a pair that shows it
does not. The composer marks every sentence it shifted, and the grounding
row keeps the note's own words (`original`), so a shifted sentence is still
checked against the note it came from.
