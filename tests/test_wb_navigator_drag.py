"""Dragging the board overview's rectangle tracks the pointer (INBOX 431).

The owner, 2026-09-28: "the fit drag mini fit map on the whiteboard and
mindmap is reallllly glitchy and laggy." The drag half of it: every pointer
move ran the whole jump (the content bounds measured from the DOM, the
overview's own box measured, a fresh projection that could rescale under the
pointer, a transform), and a press on the rectangle jumped its centre to the
pointer rather than picking it up where it was held. Now the press measures
once and freezes the projection, the moves are coalesced into one animation
frame, and the grab point is kept.

Static checks; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/minimapdrag.js` is the measurement.
