# Changelog

All notable changes to MemoryMap AI are recorded here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project follows a "waves and phases" development history (see the milestones
below). Versioning is `0.x` while the app stabilises.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Forgot your password? on the lock screen, on the computer the notebook lives on. With a recovery key (160 random bits shown once after setup, or made and replaced in Settings, Account & security) you set a new password and keep your private notes; every other session is signed out and the used key is replaced by a new one. Without it, the same reset as `python -m memorymap --reset-password`, now one shared function: ordinary notes, documents, boards and settings are kept and private notes stay sealed. The key is never stored or logged, wrong keys wait like wrong passwords, another device is refused, and re-encrypting private notes replaces the key.
- The recovery key's Download .txt in the desktop app opens a Save dialog that starts in Documents and refuses the notebook's own folder, rather than saving into the exports folder beside the notebook, where anyone who copied the folder would have the key to its private notes. A browser tab keeps its ordinary download.

### Changed

- Documents: the current line's highlight is half as strong, a place marker rather than a band.
- Dashboard, Focused view: the greeting card is a hero again (INBOX 675). The date and time are one small line over the greeting, New note sits under it, and four tiles fill the rest: what is due today, today's meetings, the notes to file and the note you were last in, each a press away. No model needed. Compact view: Quick access tiles are as wide as their words, on one line, instead of five stretched, mostly empty boxes (INBOX 677).
- Lock screen: "Forgot your password?" is a quiet link under Unlock rather than a bordered button between the field and it.
- Note cards: the text runs further across a wide card (84 characters a line rather than 72).
- Mind maps: a template dropped on a map with no central topic no longer makes one separate trunk per top-level topic. A template with several top-level topics (every built-in map template) gets a new central topic named after it, with them as its branches; a template with one top-level topic makes that topic the centre. A map that already has a central topic is unchanged, and a template still lands under the pointer and undoes in one step (INBOX 670).
- Fewer pill-shaped option wells, the last of the ones with four choices: Settings, Appearance, Font and Density are lists (each font row is set in its own face), the Graph's Layout is a list beside Colour and Size, and the suggestions inbox's four kinds (Links, Tensions, Names, Link types) are one list whose rows carry the counts, Links (3). The Attach picker's five sources stay as one strip across the dialog, each with its count (INBOX 670).
- Meeting notes, redesigned (INBOX 644): New meeting (Quick access on the Dashboard, the command palette, Library's Create, Tools and features) asks for a title, when and who, then opens one shape of note: Agenda, Notes, Decisions and Action items, typed Meeting and tagged meeting. Notes has a Meetings row. A meeting's chip opens its sheet: Remind me turns an action item ("- [ ] Send the deck @Sam by Friday") into a real reminder with no AI, asking when if the line does not say; Summarise keeps only the decisions and action items whose source words are in the notes, shows them with those words, and adds them after your own lines only when asked, with Undo; Record into it adds a transcript under Notes. A saved recording is a meeting note now, without the uncited summary it used to prepend. A meeting sits on the Timeline at its own date. The Capture box's Meeting template is the same shape, and the m then v chord is named Record a meeting.
- Command palette: Ctrl+K is commands and places only (tabs, sub-tabs, Settings pages, actions, a category, a tag); notes, documents, files, boards, reminders and conversations are no longer listed there, and typed text ends with a row, Search everything for, that opens Find anything with the words already searched (INBOX 666). Find anything is unchanged and still lists its actions after the content. The palette's prompt reads Run a command or go to a place, and the Guide, Help, the README and the Tools and features row say the same.
- Mind maps, Questions and AI skills: fewer pill-shaped option wells. A selected topic's Text, Shape and Branch line panels are now one-line rows, each choice a small preview of what it makes (the box's corners, the edge bar, the fill, the line's weight and bend), with a reset arrow to follow the map again instead of a "Map" option among the shapes; the text size on the topic's bar is a minus and a plus round the size it reads; a topic's Priority, Progress and Flag show the marks themselves; How this map looks picks the level it sets from a list. Notes, Questions (Open, Answered, Dropped) and Library, AI skills (All skills, Yours, Built-in) pick from a list with the counts on its rows. The note formatting toolbar's More now opens into rows on a phone, rather than one row running past the toolbar's edge.
- The GitHub Pages site is redesigned to read as a designed product page rather than a template: the Ask screenshot as the hero on a dark stage, with numbered pins and a key for what it shows; "How it works" as three joined steps with small in-page examples of a note, its filing and a cited answer; alternating feature rows and a bento for the smaller tools; privacy as a ledger of everything that could reach the network; install, models, FAQ and a closing download. Still one static file with no requests beyond its own screenshots, in the app's own blue and category colours, light and dark, checked at six widths with no horizontal scroll and every text colour at 4.8:1 or better.

### Fixed

- Meetings: New meeting has Start and record, which starts the meeting and transcribes straight into its notes (recording had lost its Quick access tile).
- Forgot your password: the card opens with its first path shown as chosen, and the reset command and its Copy button are one height.
- Settings, Packages: "Select its packages" takes you to the bundle's packages, the first one in view with its tick focused, and says how many it selected.
- Graph: Link together can be undone (its toast and Ctrl+Z), and a new Unlink on the selection bar removes the links between the selected notes, also undoable.
- Notes, compact rows: a row's details (category, tags, time) sit on the title's line, centred with it, and the hover buttons sit inside the row on that line, open or closed, instead of hanging half below it. The open/close arrow is one quiet button whose arrow turns, with no filled, bordered square when open, and a row opens and closes with a short height animation (none with Interface animations off) that turns back smoothly if pressed again mid-way.
- Note cards: Show more appears only when the preview actually hides text, measured once the card is laid out (a card drawn while hidden, in a later batch, or after a search used to keep it), and the preview and the opened note use the same line spacing.
- Notes: a note's hover buttons stay shown while its own ⋯ menu is open, and hide again once it closes.
- A control inside a rounded container now sits inside its corner, with its hover, pressed and keyboard-focus states (INBOX 682, 683). The Documents sidebar's "Documents | Outline" tabs were also a segmented control, so the flat looks drew the chosen tab as a grey, bordered, square slab; they are now the same underline tabs as Notes and Library, with a button-radius hover fill and focus ring. The table bar's "Copy | ... | X" drew square hover and focus shapes inside its capsule (a corner token that is 0 at a small radius setting); its buttons are fully round now, as are the board's zoom pill, the timeline's week well (concentric with the well) and the graph's zoom strip, whose focus ring was clipped to a single line. A new row in DESIGN.md and a lint hold the set.
- The corner companion no longer stops a trackpad or wheel scroll: scrolling over it scrolls the list or board beneath.
- Filing: the first note in a new notebook no longer waits behind the search model's first load. Loading it on a pause in typing shared the one queue filing uses, so on a fresh install the first note could say "Filing…" for as long as the download took.
- A note that opens with a property block (any note of a type) shows its title, not "---", on the Timeline, and its preview no longer starts with the block's raw text. The note edit form keeps such a note's block out of the text box (the Properties sheet edits it) and finds its title under the block; a title typed there is written under the block instead of above it, where it turned every property into body text.
- Atlas in the large view: a click no longer tilts it and snaps it back, and its arms move smoothly. A finished move (a wave, a look) no longer replays in jumps after it has ended; arm gestures start and end where the arm rests rather than swinging out to straight first; no arm turns more than 4 degrees a frame; a poke's wiggle swings over 1.2 seconds; a one-hand hang cut short no longer jumps sideways; and Atlas's own large view no longer redraws its arms every frame at rest (INBOX 669).
- Tools & features: the search field no longer runs into the title and close button. It is the app's standard search field now, with its magnifier and room under the head for its focus ring.
- The "?" in the Quick note (and any other dialog) opens its help again. It opened underneath the dialog, where it could not be seen or reached; the first Escape now closes the help and leaves the note open.
- Background jobs: a document that cannot be read, and a job that cannot be resumed after a restart, now show a plain sentence instead of the converter's or decoder's own error text. The detail stays in the log with its traceback.
- Questions: a question's note title is found by a loop over its first 60 characters instead of a pattern CodeQL read as quadratic. It measured linear already (a few milliseconds on 200 KB), so nothing changes on screen; the same titles come back.
- Ask: a model reply with a very long run of spaces or blank lines no longer stalls while note ids and match scores are stripped from it. The four patterns that began with optional whitespace now start only at the head of a run: 14 to 15 s on 20 KB before, under 0.01 s now, with the same text removed.
- Documents: exporting a document whose text has a long run of unclosed markup (`{++`, `[`, `![a](`) no longer takes seconds. The inline markup splitter reads the text in one pass: 0.7 to 1.9 s on 20 KB before, under 0.02 s now, with the same pieces.
- Notes: a note whose first line is a long run of unclosed `[` or `![` no longer slows the labels that show it (chips, cards, references). The link and image stripping read the line in one pass: 0.8 s on 20 KB before, under 0.01 s now.
- E2E: the first-run project no longer retries a failed test in CI. Its specs assert an empty notebook, so a retry always failed on a note left by the first attempt and hid the real failure.
- Settings, Re-encrypt private notes works again after a password reset. Private notes sealed by the reset, which no key in the notebook can open, made every re-encrypt fail; they are now left exactly as they were and every note the current key opens moves to the new key.
- Filing: the first note in a new notebook with no AI model no longer waits for the search model to load. With nothing filed yet there is nothing to compare it against, so it is not embedded on the way to Uncategorised; that load, skipped at launch for an empty notebook, could keep the first note at "Filing…" for over 20 seconds.
- Whiteboard and mind map: things placed from the Library land where you put them. A dragged shape, template or icon keeps the point you held it by under the pointer (the drag now carries the shape's picture, not the whole tile), a click puts it in the middle of the canvas you can see rather than partly under the open Library, a dropped note's card is centred on the pointer whatever its height, and a mind map template lands under the pointer instead of 240px away. Measured at 50%, 100% and 200% with the view panned: within 0.5px everywhere, where it was up to 165px off on a click and 580px on a drag. A dropped note is now one undo step, and on a mind map the topic a branch template or icon will join is highlighted while you hold it over it.
- Dashboard: Narrow on the activity heatmap now sticks. The heatmap is the one widget that starts wide, and narrowing it saved an empty list of wide widgets, which the dashboard read as never chosen and widened it again; widgets set back to one column are now remembered on their own.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-06

### Highlights

- Capture and filing, checked end to end: a note typed in Capture is saved, filed and findable after a reload, with or without an AI model. 49 browser tests now run on every change, including the flows that were broken in 0.3.32.
- Works fully with no AI model: filing by your notebook's own words, search, Ask with cited sources, reminders from plain words, and clear next steps wherever a model would help.
- Filing certainty you can trust: a model's pick never reads 100%, drops when your notes disagree, and offers other categories to tap when it is unsure.
- Nothing lost: unsaved edits to a note or a document survive a reload or a closed window and are offered back; deletes go to the bin or can be undone.
- Mind maps: a real hierarchy by default (a central topic, main branches, leaves), four looks, per-level styles, copy and paste style, and topic icons.
- An emoji and icon library: 1,500 icons and nearly 500 emoji, placed as stickers on boards and maps or inserted from the editors' toolbars.
- Whiteboard: drag an item onto a delete target to remove it (with Undo); links follow an item while it turns.
- The Writing room (was Write with Atlas), chat progress that says what Atlas is doing, refreshed Atlas avatars, and a clearer "AI off" status.
- Interface animations: subtle, cheap motion (a sliding tab indicator, menus that grow from their button, toasts that slide in), with its own switch in Appearance.
- The document editor: a current-line highlight with line numbers, and whole-line copy and cut, as in VS Code.
- Security: HTTPS for other devices on your network, a stronger password rule, private notes kept out of saved answers, backups and the search index, and nothing touches the network until you allow update checks.
- Windows: the installer and packaged app were audited (17 fixes), and every build now installs, upgrades over the last release and uninstalls in CI.
- A new GitHub Pages site and fresh README screenshots.

### Security

- Agent mode: a very long question with a long dotted run in it (a pasted list of versions or addresses) no longer stalls the turn before it starts; the check for sites you named took over a minute on 64,000 characters and now reads it in one pass (the final scan, 2026-10-06).
- Import from other apps: an Evernote or Notion export can no longer stall the import with a crafted run of unclosed tags, brackets or spaces; five of the patterns that read it backtracked quadratically (2 to 10 seconds on 20 to 180 KB, so minutes on a 200 MB export) and now read in one pass (the final scan, 2026-10-06).
- Agent mode: once a turn has read text from outside, opening a page still waits for your confirm, except the exact address a web search returned in that turn or a page on a site you named in your question; the same page with something added (a query string, a longer path) or a name that only ends like your site still asks. Research turns no longer stack a confirm card per page, and a page still cannot send your notes anywhere by itself (SEC-02's last step, audit 2026-10-05).
- Passwords: a new password (setting one up, or changing it) needs at least 8 characters, and one that is still easy to guess (a common choice, 12345678, one kind of character in a short one) is accepted with a warning that says why; a password set before this keeps opening the notebook. Before, a 4-character PIN was allowed, and a copy of the notebook file guesses that offline in minutes (SEC-17, audit 2026-10-05).
- Private notes: making a note private now also redacts every saved Ask answer and chat reply that cited it, or repeats six or more of its words in a row (an agent's tool step and its thinking included); the answer says its words were removed and your question stays. Before, an answer that quoted the note kept its words readable in Ask history, the conversation and the database file (SEC-14, audit 2026-10-05).
- Import a folder: running it again is safe. A file whose place in the folder and whose text are already a note is passed over (a note made private since is matched by its place alone), so importing again finishes an import that was cut off instead of doubling every note, and the activity line says how many were already in; one file that fails no longer stops the files after it (SEC-10, audit 2026-10-05).
- Other devices: the network is served over HTTPS now, with a certificate made on this computer the first time the switch is on (no network, kept in the data folder, owner-only), on its own port, 8443 beside the usual 8000; this computer keeps plain http. Settings, Account and security shows the certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint to compare with the one-time warning a phone shows, and Regenerate certificate makes a new one without a restart. Before, the password and the session token crossed the network in the clear (SEC-08, the owner's decision of 2026-10-05).
- Updates: the first start asks once whether to check for updates automatically (in the terminal for start.sh, in the app otherwise, the packaged app included) and remembers the answer; until then nothing about updating touches the network, the launchers' pull and the doctor's remote check included. Before, a copy started with start.sh or start.bat ran a pull on every launch unasked. Settings, About's button is now Check for updates and checks once even with the switch off (the owner's decision, 2026-10-05).
- Other devices: `--reset-password` turns "Allow other devices on this network" off, the launcher listens on this computer only while no password is set, and a request that arrives from the network before a password exists is refused (403), however the server was started; before, a reset with the switch on reopened the whole notebook to the network with no password (SEC-01, audit 2026-10-05). The help says the traffic is plain http, for networks you trust (SEC-08).
- Agent mode: a note clipped from the web or brought in by an import, and an imported document, now count as text from outside, like a web page: once a turn has read one (by a tool, or because it was retrieved for the question), every change to the notebook (edit, create, save a skill, set a reminder, rename) and every web request waits for your confirm, and the card says what it will do; before, only destructive tools and web requests after a web search asked, so a clipped page could steer the agent into rewriting a skill or a note unasked (SEC-02, audit 2026-10-05).
- Private notes: making a note private now merges the search index so none of its words stay in the database file or its write-ahead log, and every backup and the Export backup zip is a cleaned snapshot, which also strips words an older version left behind; before, a private note's vocabulary (a PIN, a place) was readable with strings in every backup (SEC-03, audit 2026-10-05). The Export backup zip also stops missing changes still in the write-ahead log.
- Sign-in: a wrong current password in Change password and Re-encrypt private notes now counts against the same wait as a wrong unlock (SEC-04); a request that names another site's domain is refused on this computer too, not only from the network, so a DNS-rebinding page can no longer lock you out or close your private notes, Lock does nothing without a live session, and Origin null is refused on the sign-in routes (SEC-05); a request body is capped at 1 MB until signed in, before it is read (SEC-06); a password over 72 bytes (a long passphrase, 25 emoji) works instead of failing with an error, and one over 1,024 characters is refused (SEC-09).
- Backups: restoring one now signs every session out and asks for the password, so the restored private notes open with the key that came with them; before, a restore across a key rotation left new private notes unreadable after the next restart (SEC-07).
- Attachments are served as downloads unless they are pictures or PDFs, sandboxed, so an uploaded script can never run in the app (SEC-11); a user name and password typed into the model server address stay out of the support bundle and the privacy receipt (SEC-12); on Linux and macOS the notebook folder is readable by its owner only (SEC-13).
- A note's source address must be a web address, and every link the audit found opened without the link check (a note's source chip, a chat source card, the palette's sources, a link card, a bookmark row) now goes through it (SEC-15).

### Changed
- Tags: a tag typed and entered before the tag list had loaded no longer opens the list afterwards over the note form's Save changes, where a press meant for Save took a tag nobody chose.
- Dictate with the voice add-on not installed, Compress on a chat with nothing to compress yet, and Add on an empty reminder now say so as a plain message instead of an error with Report this.
- Documents: words typed just before a reload or a closed window (inside the 1.2 s autosave pause, or after a save the server refused) are kept on this device, and the next open of that document offers them back with Put them back.
- Documentation checked against the code, file by file (README, INSTALL, MODELS, PRIVACY, TROUBLESHOOTING, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, DESIGN): the README lists this release's features (the Writing room, Interface animations, the emoji and icon library and stickers, mind map levels and looks, drag to delete, chat progress phases, whole-line copy, the active line, the Back and Forward list, HTTPS for other devices, the first-start update question); INSTALL, PRIVACY and CONTRIBUTING say the update check asks once at first start; MODELS names the suggested-download groups and fit labels the app shows; TROUBLESHOOTING gains the certificate warning on another device; ARCHITECTURE's directory map, router table, script counts (107 files, 38 at boot), graph layouts, tables and migration head match the tree; DESIGN's tokens and class names that no longer exist are gone (INBOX 645).
- README screenshots retaken again, all 22, from a fresh showcase notebook (75 notes, the mind map now with icons and a look per level): the first-start update question no longer sits over the dashboard, and `readmeshots.js` counts toasts, skeletons and open dialogs at each capture (INBOX 645).
- The project website (GitHub Pages) is rebuilt as one static landing page in the app's own look, light and dark: what MemoryMap is, the capture, filing and ask loop, a tour of the screenshots, privacy and offline, install, models, questions people ask, and links to the release, the source, issues and every policy on GitHub. It no longer loads the documents from the repository, which often failed, and names no version, date or count, so it does not go stale (INBOX 645).
- Back and forward list: each row is an icon for its kind (note, document, board, map, tab), the title as plain text (markdown and file names gone; an image-only note is titled by its caption or "Image"), a small lazy thumbnail when a note opens with a picture, and the tab or sub-tab in muted text beneath; consecutive identical rows fold into one (Back and Forward still walk the exact history). The rows moved into a lazy bundle, so the boot JS is 418 bytes lighter (588,744 to 588,326 gzipped).
- Motion: Settings, Appearance, Effects & accessibility has Interface animations, on by default: the short, cheap animations of the interface play even with Reduce motion or the system's reduced-motion setting on, and turning it off makes every one of them instant (Reduce motion now stills the large movement only: Atlas, the background art, the graph and the whiteboard). One sliding marker for every tab strip: the top bar, the sub-tabs, every segmented control, the Settings sections and a pane's groups slide to the chosen option and land on it after a resize. Buttons and chips press in, menus and help popovers grow from what opened them and close back faster, dialogs and sheets leave the way they came, a page or Notes section fades in a little quicker, lists settle in where their placeholders were, toasts arrive from the bottom and the others slide to make room, focus rings and hovers ease in; no interface animation moves a shadow, a size or a position property. The guided tour's script now loads when a tour starts or Settings, Help opens, 11 KB less at start-up.
- Notes and documents: Emoji or icon in the note toolbar, the document's Insert menu and the / menu opens the same picker and puts the choice at the caret, an emoji as itself and a Phosphor icon as `:ph-name:`, which the reading view draws as the icon (never inside code). Before, the only way to an emoji was the document editor's `:shortcode:` completion, and no icon could go in text at all (INBOX 642, MINDMAP_PLAN decision 46; mc1-editoricons.js 7/7).
- Boards and maps: Insert, Emoji and icons… opens the icon and emoji picker and keeps it open: a press places one in the middle of the view, a drag places it under the pointer. An emoji lands as a sticker (no card, its glyph sized to its box, exported as itself), a Phosphor icon as the library's vector icon you can recolour, and either dropped on a map topic becomes its icon; each is one Undo step (INBOX 642, MINDMAP_PLAN decision 44, WHITEBOARD_PLAN 37; mc1-stickers.js 8/8).
- Mind maps: a topic's icon can be any of the 1,530 vendored Phosphor icons or one of about 470 emoji, from the one icon and emoji picker (the Text menu's More icons and emoji…): search, a Recent row, Emoji and Icons, arrows and Enter, Escape back to the button; an emoji is drawn as itself and kept in the OPML and FreeMind exports. Before, a topic could wear one of 11 icons and no emoji (INBOX 641, 642; MINDMAP_PLAN decisions 43, 45; mc1-iconpicker.js 12/12). The picker is a lazy module, so nothing loads until it is opened.
- Mind maps: View, How this map looks picks the hierarchy (Classic, Outline, Boxed or Flat) and, under Centre, Main branches or Sub-topics, that level's size, bold, italic, box, edge bar, fill and line; a topic's menu has a Look group with Copy this topic's style and Paste style (Ctrl+Alt+C and V now reach topics, which they refused before), and Use this look for its level, which gives the topic's own look to every topic at its level (Illustrator's Redefine). Each is one Undo step (INBOX 641, MINDMAP_PLAN decisions 40 to 42; mc1-maplook.js 13/13).
- Mind maps draw as a hierarchy: the centre is large, bold and filled in the accent (22px on a pill), each main branch bold at 17px on a tinted card with a thick line, deeper topics as before; a topic's own size, shape or fill still wins, a map-wide text size now reaches the deeper topics and leaves the centre alone, and Enter on the centre adds a main branch rather than a second centre. A topic's Fill offers Solid colour. Measured before: centre, branch and leaf all 13.6px at weight 400 (INBOX 641, MINDMAP_PLAN decisions 38, 39, 47; mc1-maplevels.js 13/13).
- Package check (CI): the frozen Windows app is now proven on every lazily loaded script and stylesheet (read from app.js's LAZY_MODULES, so the list cannot drift), each with its MIME type, and on the API a packaged build can get wrong: search, a stats question answered without a model, the backup exports including the sealed bundle, and the Alembic stamp on a fresh data dir; no traceback in its output and nothing written into its own folder. It installs a second optional package (Pyodide, the app's own download path), upgrades over the latest published release and checks the note, version, schema, shortcuts and stale files, and checks the uninstaller removes the whole install folder. The release build runs the same smoke, and the check now runs for any change to the app, the frontend or the migrations.
- Boot budget: the Attach picker's row (`pick-row.js`), "Unlock private notes" (`vault-unlock.js`), the skill editor's verify and tool readers and the Library's Remind me moved out of the boot scripts into the lazy files that use them; boot JS 588,744 to 587,342 bytes gzipped, app scripts 320,610 to 319,208.
- Notes: an edit left unsaved in a note's form is kept on this device until Save or Cancel, so a reload answered Leave, or a closed desktop window, no longer loses it; the next start offers Open them. The Guide says so
- Dashboard: the boards widget's New board waits for the boards' code, as Library, Create does now; both did nothing on a first visit since the Library tab began loading library.js alone (FE-03(c)), and both worked in 0.3.32
- Ask: a question that names a category as where its notes are ("Summarise my notes in Health.", one Ask suggests itself, or "my Work notes") is answered from that category; it was answered from whatever matched the words, other categories included, with a model and without
- Filing: when a slow model's answer replaces the words-based stand-in, the composer's line follows it (it said "Filed under Health" and nothing said the model then moved the note to Work), and a move is said in a toast with Put it back
- Command palette: Take the guided tour (Ctrl+K, "tour") opens the tour from anywhere; it was reachable only from the Dashboard's first-run tile and Settings, Help. The Guide's tour topic says so
- Import: Markdown files and folders now join up their [[wiki links]] as links (the Graph showed an imported vault with none until each note was saved again), and choosing the same files again adds only what is new, saying how many were already in
- Graph: Concept maps landed on the Library's All view on a first visit to the Library instead of on the boards; it now waits for the Library before opening Boards & maps
- Boards: Library, Create, New board and New mind map did nothing on a first visit to Boards (the button was pressed before the boards' code had bound it); they now open the board gallery and make the board
- Documents: Library, Create, New document on a first visit opened the last document instead of making one, so a title and text typed there went into an existing document; it now makes the document, and a link to a document (#/docs/2) is no longer replaced by the newest one as the tab finishes loading
- Library: Ctrl+K, Open the bin on a session that had not opened the Library yet showed "Nothing of this kind yet." under a full Everything count; a cross-fade render that was overtaken by the load no longer draws its empty list over the loaded one
- E2E: the Playwright suite drives capture and filing end to end against a real server on a seeded 75-note notebook (filed by meaning with no model, tags, title, a picked category, search, timeline, graph, Undo and Redo, Quick note, paste), and a first-run project on a fresh data dir
- Manuscript look: muted text is a shade darker, so it reads at 4.5:1 or better on Settings' cards; 17 labels and facts in Search and index, Account, Skills and Tools were at 4.33 to 4.47:1 (qa-1005, contrast.js LOOK=manuscript: 17 to 0).
- Settings, Logs: the filter hint reads "Filter logs", which fits the field on a phone ("Filter records…" was cut off at 390; qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js placeholders).
- Notes: opening a note for editing in the first seconds after the app opens (or on a slow disk) holds the note's place with placeholders while the form loads; before, the card dropped to an empty 15px strip and every note under it jumped up and back (qa-1005).
- Notes on a phone: a card's connection pills keep to one line, their words cut with an ellipsis, as Ask's results already did; at 390 they wrapped to two small lines inside a one-line pill (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js linkpills).
- Settings: a text field in a settings row wraps onto its own line rather than shrinking; on a phone the server address field was 62px wide and five hints were cut off, one at desktop width too ("Optional, 8 or more character"); a template's description hint is shorter (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js placeholders: 6 to 0).
- Settings: a status line with nothing to say takes no room; nine cards (Models' backend card, three in Tools, Web search, three in Import and export) ended on 27px of empty paragraph margin (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js settingspad: 9 to 0).
- Notes: between 1100 and 1170 wide the notes bar no longer lays its Filter menu under the sort picker ("FiNewest first"); it wraps its actions to a second row instead, and stays one row at 1184 and wider (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js dockoverlap: 1 to 0).
- Library: the Cards and Rows switch shows your choice the moment the tab opens, and Boards & maps shows placeholders while its editors load; before, the switch had neither pressed until the list answered and the sub-tab was blank until the boards' bundle arrived (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js with both held 3s: 0 and 0, then 1 and 4).
- Notes: a task line in a note card draws as a box (ticked ones muted and struck through), as the note page and documents draw it; before, the card showed the line as written, dash and brackets included (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js).
- Chat, Notes and Library empty states: the Ask Atlas offer is set apart by space, not by a short hairline floating in the middle of the centred welcome (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js: 3 rules to 0).
- Reminders: a hovered reminder's actions now cover its time whole; on a reminder linked to a note (two lines) the strip sat 11px low and the top half of the time showed above it (qa-1005, qa1005-polish.js: 6 rows to 0).
- Notes and Library: a drag-selection begun in the first seconds after the app opens (or on a slow disk) now scrolls the list at its edge like every later one; before, the edge scroll's file had not arrived and the first drag scrolled 0px (qa-1005, measured 756px with the file held back 1.5s).
- Menus: every menu now fades out over 120ms instead of vanishing (one CSS transition on the hidden state, so the opener, Escape, a press outside and every other close path get it); a menu that was moved out of a clipping scroller goes home after the fade; reduced motion keeps the instant hide.
- Maps: a topic the render pass did not repaint no longer takes the server's placeholder height into the size cache, so pans, rings and edge ends computed from a topic's size land on its box (they were 12px off at 390 and 38px at 1440 after a state fetch); mapstrip.js holds it to 4px.
- Sweeps: left1005-frametitle.js measures nested frames at a phone's fitted zoom (the outer title's words always reach the outer frame) and resets its board before its last drag, which the edge auto-pan had been taking.
- Write with Atlas on a phone: the what-to-write select takes its own line, so it and tone and length show their values (they were cut to 16px in one row of four controls); phonecapture.js and tablefullclose.js measure the Writing Room and the table full view at 390.
- Sketch pad: below 820px the ink dots keep their gap, so no two colour targets overlap (six pairs did at 700 with Large text and Spacious); the bar's one allowed second row is 820 with Large text and Spacious, and sketchbar.js now measures ten widths.
- Sweeps: contrast.js now reads a board and a map (open, every item selected, each sidebar tab) at 1440 and 390 in both themes; none fails, the sticky's drag grip included.
- Gate: scripts/gate.sh --staged lints the staged index once instead of the working tree and then the index (the same lint set twice); with nothing staged it lints the working tree, so it never runs zero lints (tests/test_gate_staged_once.py).
- Graph: the zoom strip's four buttons (Full screen included) are checked to be what a finger hits at 390, clear of the New note button; the report of Full screen sitting under a small button no longer reproduces.
- Empty lines: the last nine (Documents' list, outline and two histories, Chat's saved chats, Ask's history, the graph pane, the board's overview and Format panel) are the one empty-line recipe, so every short "nothing here yet" line is one size, ink and margin; the lint's waiting list is empty (`tests/test_ui_recipes.py`, `op5-1005.js` MODE=emptylines).
- Mind maps: Branch colours offers eight palettes, four new (Bold, Paired, Bright, Earth), each colour at least 1.6:1 on white so a branch line never vanishes; MINDMAP_PLAN §12.1 closed (its open rows found built or superseded) and moved to HISTORY (`tests/test_map_theme_palette.py`).
- Tests: the edit-embeds tests drain the shared job pool before and after each test (its dedupe key was shared by every test editing note 1), hold the embedder on its gate until released, and wait with 60 s ceilings.
- Tests: the 5,000-entity merge-candidates speed check is measured in process CPU time, with the 1 s budget unchanged.
- Tests: the extras install-history test polls for the history row, because the worker lowers the running flag a few statements before it records the row.
- Tests: the relations cost test measures the 2k and 10k passes in process CPU time, so the five-times-the-notes, ten-times-the-time ratio no longer drifts with machine load.
- Tests: the lexical-filing tests no longer fail on a loaded machine: the wait for the background filing pass has a 90 s ceiling and raises a clear error instead of returning a pending status, and the 800-note speed check is measured in process CPU time.
- Tests: the debug-health tests no longer fail on a loaded machine: the running-job test holds the re-index on an Event and waits for the worker to enter it (it was a 5 s sleep raced against the request), and the 20 ms budget is measured in process CPU time with the budget and fastest-sample rule unchanged.
- Sweeps and docs: `errors.js` runs a browser per width with `--disable-dev-shm-usage` and reports a renderer crash as a finding; `noteeditflow.js` and `noteedit616.js` seed their own bookmark and note so they pass on a fresh data dir; thirty-eight finished agent files left `docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/` for the archive, their open rows carried into `OPEN.md`.
- Export activity: events about a private note stay out of the file after the note is purged too (a purge seals its events, dropping their text and flagging them private, and the export leaves flagged events out)
- Settings: a status line that names a server address (Models, "Saved, but nothing is answering at ...") and a long Ask Atlas question in a help popover wrap inside the pane at 390 instead of running it sideways
- Gzip caps back down: the list drag-select edge scroll moved whole into drag-edge.js and the note edit form's formatting strip into note-edit-panels.js (both lazy, one caller each), boot JS cap 589,600 to 588,400 and the scripts total 321,500 to 320,300; the edge scroll loads three seconds after boot, so a drag in the first seconds does not scroll at the edge
- Settings, Background tasks: the optimisation pass's model override says which model its default means ("Same as utility model (currently ...)").
- Settings, Models, Installed models: each model you have is a card like the suggested downloads, with its size on this computer and what it is in use for; its menu puts it to use, copies its name or removes it.
- Appearance: a theme card's preview and swatch, and a setup snippet in Settings, round their corners inside their card's corner (concentric) at every corner setting.
- Appearance and layout: the shadow strength slider now changes every shadow at every step in light and dark, every palette included, from none to the strongest, with 5% looking as before; in light, a text field is a shade deeper than a segmented control beside it, as in dark; the Ask results sit in one column below 1100px wide instead of two narrow ones; and a short "nothing here" line in the agent panel and Settings lists is one size and spacing everywhere.
- Chat, Attach: a mind map's row shows the map's own shape, a PDF's row its first page (where pages can be drawn), and a document's row whether it is prose, a table or code, each in the same small tile as before.
- Layout: from 600 to 719px wide the status bar and the dashboard's quick access now look as they do up to 819px (the tablet band), instead of switching to their phone sizes 120px early.
- Docs: the no-em-dash lint now covers docs/**/*.md, docs/index.html and the root *.md files, and the 5,900 em-dashes it found are reworded (comma, colon, parentheses or full stop); the two changelogs stay identical.
- Docs: MODELS.md now says `qwen3.5:35b-a3b` is about 21 GB and needs about 24 GB, as the in-app catalogue does (it said 24 GB and 32 GB); `tests/test_models_doc_sizes.py` pins every catalogue model's size and stated memory in that file to the catalogue.
- Suggested links: Link all above 70% asks first, says how many pairs actually linked (Linked 3 of 4), and a pair whose link failed stays in the list; the Links help line and the Guide name it.
- Settings at phone width: a setting's label no longer stands 114 to 202px tall above its control (39 rows, the gap above Tokens per step in Tools it can use); the stacked row sizes the label to its text.
- Notes and Library: a text selection dragged within about 56px of the top or bottom of the list scrolls it, faster the closer to the edge (the browser alone covered only the last 20px); the selection follows (INBOX 608).
- Startup: the note edit form, the full backup's save and restore and seven other helpers that only one lazily loaded file calls moved into that file (and, after the edit form's redesign merged, the embedding models list, the form's close and the Settings bar's New listener), and the edit form's bundle is fetched a few seconds after start so the first Edit does not wait; the scripts the app loads at start are 589,955 bytes gzipped (from 601,448 after the day's merges), and the boot, app.js, total and guard caps are lowered to the measure.
- Settings, Packages: bundles of the packages one kind of work needs together (Documents, Vision, AI, Voice, Desktop, Code). A bundle's Install fetches the ones still missing, and its ⋯ reinstalls or removes them all; tick any packages to install, reinstall or remove them together from the selection bar. They run one after another as one background job with its progress in the activity panel, each package says how it went under its row, one that fails does not stop the rest, and Quit stops the rest. An installed package shows its version and its size on disk, and Reinstall and Remove are in its ⋯. Offline, an install says it could not reach PyPI rather than that the package does not exist (INBOX 595).
- Documents, Download as .docx: pictures come along now. A picture on a line of its own keeps the width, alignment and caption you gave it (`![A river|400|center](...)`) and is fitted to the page; one in a sentence stays in its line; each keeps its alt text. A picture that is missing, on the web or in a format Word cannot hold stays as its words (FEAT-18).
- Atlas's props move of their own while they show (INBOX 623): the lantern swings on its string and its star flickers, the bell sways, the offline link sparks, the music's cups pulse, the night moon rocks on its ear, the reading lenses catch the light, the book's pages lift and its stars twinkle, the map rocks and twinkles, the coil breathes, the startle's bubble wobbles and its "!" pops. Each moves about where it is held and holds still with Avatar animation off or under reduced motion.
- Atlas, in its large view: the companion visiting it floats free in the middle of the view, clear of the card's edges, instead of hanging from its perch's edge or sitting on a drawn ledge, and sways and bobs on the view's two clocks between its acts; its perch's pose comes back with it when the view closes. An act is eased into over 0.3s, as it was already eased out of (INBOX 619).
- Atlas: lying down and curled up, the whole figure turns as one; the lower body and her waist wisps no longer turn 16 to 42 degrees off the torso, which stayed nearly upright while the lower body lay half off it (INBOX 619).
- Atlas: the torso and the lower body meet as one silhouette (INBOX 615, and 619 for her). The lower body moves inside the body's own sway and breath, and its own swing (the hem's wind, the walk, a pose's lean) is a shear about the join rather than a turn, so the waist stays under the torso while the hem moves; his cloak is a little narrower at the waist.
- Atlas: its eyes never go blank. Changing to or from the heart eyes, the iris and the heart now cross over on one clock, on the companion and in its wake and doze; before, the companion's iris cut out at once while the heart faded in, leaving a white eye for up to half a second (INBOX 619).
- Atlas, his look: a slimmer, athletic young-adult build to match hers (19 to 21): defined shoulders tapering in a V to a narrow waist (shoulders, waist and hips 17, 9.5 and 9.8 across where they were 18.6, 15.1 at the belly and 10), slimmer arms, and a cloak and tail that taper with it (INBOX 614).
- Atlas: its tail grows out of its lower body (wide where it leaves, in the body's own colour, deepening into the galaxy along its length) and is alive: it bends along its whole length as a spine does, a wave running from root to tip, and changes what it does every few seconds at random (a lazy sway, a curl, a wrap, a flick, a wag when pleased, a trail on the move, a droop when low), each change eased and never the same twice running. The celestial rings sway their tilt, each on its own clock, with their dust running round them; the planets go round faster, and each planet's glow swells and its swirl of light turns. A poke in the large view now eases back into its idle motion instead of snapping still, and a companion drawn from a name keeps a gentle sway there between its acts. Her arms turn about her own shoulders, so her right arm no longer pulls away from her body as it moves. Double-click or double-tap the companion's resize handle to put it back to Medium (INBOX 600, 601, 612).
- The bars at the top of every tab and Library view read as one quiet page head: the title with no divider after it, a count as plain muted words, a search box with a magnifier and no border until you type in it, the icon buttons together at the end and the one filled action last. The graph's display options are one aligned column with one head style, and Settings lists a long section's groups under its name in the sidebar (on a phone, in the section picker) instead of a strip that scrolled sideways; nothing in Settings scrolls sideways now.
- Reminders: snoozing one (+1h, tomorrow, 10 minutes) has an Undo in its toast and in the status bar's pair, which puts the old time back even when it was already past; `PUT /reminders/{id}` takes `restore` for that (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN row 32).
- Mind maps: Branches from my notes. On a topic, Add, Branches from my notes… (or Ctrl+K) suggests up to five children found in your own notes, each saying which note it came from; with a model running it names a topic for each, without one the notes' titles are the suggestions. Tick the ones to keep and Add makes them under the topic, each with its source in its note, as one Undo step (the features audit's FEAT-13; WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 36).
- Whiteboard: connection points, like draw.io's. With Select, pointing at a shape, card or text box shows where a connector can attach, on the shape itself: a diamond's tips and side middles, a triangle's corners and sides, an ellipse's compass points (they were its box's corners, off the shape); drag from one to draw an elbow connector with an arrow to whatever you let go on, or to a free end. Links made before keep their ends. Moving both things a connector joins now moves its bends with them, in the same Undo step (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 35).
- Whiteboard: smart guides line a dragged item up with drawn shapes too (a flowchart's boxes are shapes, and had nothing to snap to), and the third box of a row snaps to the spacing the first two set, with the two gaps marked while you drag; Alt still turns every guide off (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 34).
- Whiteboard: a board's History, a time machine (the features audit's W2). Board, History… puts a slider at the foot of the board: drag it back (or press Left, Home and End) and the board is drawn as it was at each moment, a moment being a run of changes up to two minutes long, with what it added, changed and removed; Put back restores the whole board, or only what was selected, as one Undo step and as a change in the history itself; Esc comes back to now. Nothing on the board can be changed while the past is shown. Items placed from the library now each have their own history, so they go back and forth like anything drawn by hand (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 33).
- Whiteboard: a Mermaid flowchart's subgraphs come in as frames (they were left out). Each subgraph, nested or not, is a frame with its title round exactly its own shapes, laid out as one block so no other shape falls inside it; an edge to a subgraph joins its frame; the whole import is still one Undo. The Mermaid export writes the board's frames back out as subgraphs (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 32).
- Whiteboard: bends on every connector, and line jumps (draw.io's). A straight or curved connector takes bends as an elbow does: drag the ring in the middle of a run (or double-click the line) to add one, drag a bend to move it, double-click it to take it out; a straight line runs through its bends, a curved one curves smoothly through them, and changing the line shape keeps them (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 30). A double-click or a click on the ring no longer drops a stray bend where it was. The Format panel's new Line jumps (arc, gap or sharp) makes a connector hop over every line under it where they cross, in the SVG export too (decision 31).
- Skills: a new built-in, Write a document from a tag, asks which tag, reads every note under it and saves one document that draws on them (the notes themselves are never edited); run it from the skills above the chat box or ask for it in Chat. There are 21 built-in skills now.
- Settings, Import & export: a full backup can be sealed with a password (it saves as a .mmenc file, AES-GCM with the same scrypt key the private notes use; empty keeps the plain .zip), and a new Restore a full backup group reads either kind back: a wrong password or a file that is not a notebook changes nothing, your current notebook is snapshotted first, and attached files are put back over the ones here without deleting any. Before, the full backup zip could be saved but nothing in the app could read it. Measured through the real controls at 1440 and 390, light and dark: three notes binned, a wrong password refused, the right one brings all three back.
- Chat: an answer to a question about your notes is numbered as it streams, the way the Ask tab does it: each source number appears when the sentence it backs is finished, instead of all at once with the last word (`grounding_live` is read by the Chat tab's stream; the markers are put back after every live paint). Measured with a stand-in model at 1440 and 390: the first number lands about 1.8 seconds before the answer ends, where it landed with the last word.
- Settings, About, Health: a Files on disk row says what attached files, pictures and backups weigh beside the database (`GET /storage` carries the three sizes, from a walk cached for a minute).
- Library: a Highlights chip lists every passage you marked with ==words== (or a colour), one card each with the note it is in, and pressing one opens the note; search takes `has:highlight`, and a highlight is read the same way in both.
- Filing: a note of one to three words is filed by meaning only when its nearest filed note is close (0.72), so "ai is cool" no longer lands in whichever category is least far; measured with the shipped embedding model, 59 of 60 short notes that have a home still file and 3 of 20 that have none do (it was all 20). Otherwise it falls to your notebook's own words, or the model.
- Background tasks: notes that were filed by your notebook's own words while no model was available get a second opinion once one is back (20 a tick); the ones the model files elsewhere move, and the rest are marked as the AI's, so moving one by hand teaches the filer. Never a private, binned or hand-filed note.
- Library, Activity: an Export activity button saves the activity log as a spreadsheet (time, actor, action, entity kind, entity id and title; never a payload value), oldest first, with events about private notes and the vault left out, every cell defanged against CSV formula injection (a leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or carriage return gets a `'` in front), `limit`/`offset` paging and `X-Total-Count`, and the export is itself logged; `GET /audit/export.csv`.
- Settings: Personas, Skills and Templates have New persona, New skill and New template in the bar at the top of the pane, which opens the form, ends an edit in progress and puts the cursor in its Name field; on a phone it is a + on the title's row.
- Quick sketch: more room under the title and close button, and a quieter toolbar, a soft tint with no border and no lines between its groups; the white ink dot has a ring so it shows on a light bar, and the black one on a dark bar (INBOX 620).
- The top bar and the status bar, polished (INBOX 618). The spaces picker is a quiet control the shape of a tab, with no box; the tab you are on is marked by its fill alone, not also drawn heavier; the logo is a smaller tile; Quit is quieter than the other icons until you point at it. In the status bar the note and reminder counts are quiet, Agent, Guide and Find are icons (hover one for its name and keys) with Commands the one worded button, and back, forward and history sit with undo and redo as one group, without the line between them.
- Notes: the edit form is redesigned again (INBOX 616). The title is large text with no box of its own; under it one line of properties, the category chip then the tags as small padded chips and Add tag, with no boxed field and no # icon; the formatting strip is one row of icons (Bold, Italic, Strikethrough and Code are icons now, not typed letters) that never folds into an empty band, the rest behind More, in Capture too; Related folds into one "3 suggested links" line until opened; the foot is Attach a link and the word count, then Cancel and Save. Attach a link works: it opens the bookmark picker, and the link you pick shows under the text as a reference. Before, it put a list into a panel that was hidden while the note had no reference, so the press showed nothing.
- Scratchpad: 433 one-off sweeps, seed scripts and outputs deleted (1,394 tracked files to 963, 9.7 MB to 8.2 MB); git history keeps them. `scratchpad/cleanup_inventory.py` marks each file KEEP or DELETE, `scratchpad/README.md` states the rule and how to retire a sweep once its finding is here, and `tests/test_scratchpad_size.py` caps the tracked count at 1,003.
- Dialogs: every dialog's buttons at the foot are one height and in one order (INBOX 599): Cancel or the other quiet choices first, the one filled action last, at the right. Before, eight dialogs (New space, Delete space, templates, Quick note, the word goal and others) drew their Cancel 40px and their action 38px beside the confirm box's 32px, and Extract to notes and Improve writing put the filled action first, at the left.
- Notes: the edit form is one composition (INBOX 606). The title, the formatting strip and the text are one box, like the capture box; tags are chips you add with Enter or a comma and remove with a press; the category is its chip with a menu; Cancel and the filled Save sit at the right of the form's foot with Attach a link as an icon at its left; each related note has a quiet + to link it instead of a boxed Link button. Measured at 1440: Save was mid-row before Cancel, 3 boxed buttons under the form, 0 now; on a phone the New note button no longer floats over Save.
- Startup: about 8 KB less script (gzipped) loads before the app is usable. The Settings window's save and apply handlers, the "m" chord's guide, the duplicate finder, the palette's notes rows, the code highlighter and the board and note pickers now load with the screen that alone uses them; nothing on screen changes. The size caps in the tests are lowered to the new measures.
- Command palette: notes and documents come from the same search engine as Find anything, so a typo ("gardn") finds the note, a word inside a document finds the document (even before the Library has been opened), and notes past the page the browser holds are found. Typing still shows the in-memory matches at once; the engine's answer lands a moment later and leads the group.
- Library search: the Semantic filter asks the same search engine as the Notes tab and Find anything (words, meaning and links ranked together) instead of a separate cosine-only list, so the three boxes agree on what a question finds. It still only adds notes to what the words matched.
- Notes search: the filter understands has: (link, file, image, reminder), space: and kind:, asked of the same search engine as Find anything (before, each was read as a plain word and matched nothing); and the Semantic switch ranks through that engine too, shows the notes it found by meaning even when they share no word with the box, and keeps its best-first order under Newest first. Before, the list threw away its own semantic results unless they also contained the typed words.
- Settings: every pane opens on one bar, like the Library's views (INBOX 599): the pane's title, its jump links (Your skills, Add your own, ...) and its ? in one row that stays at the top as you scroll, where before a large title sat over a separate strip of links. Background tasks has its title back, and the Logs title is the same size as the others (it was 12px).
- Library: a document card's menu has Show in graph, which turns the graph's Documents switch on and centres the map on that document, the way a note's already did.
- Library, AI skills: the dock is one row again down to a 1100 window (INBOX 599). The sort is an icon-and-caret button (the order is still on its tooltip and read aloud), and on a narrow window the All, Yours and Built-in segment shows each icon with its count; before, at 1100 and 820 the segment and a wide Yours first box fell to a second row (90px against 50).
- Mind maps: import an XMind file (.xmind, XMind Zen and later): Import outline… reads its first sheet with its central topic as the map's root, and each topic's notes. An XMind 8 file is refused with how to get the newer one.
- Whiteboard: a board in and out as text (W5). Insert, Mermaid or board SVG brings in a Mermaid flowchart (pasted or a .mmd file) as shapes and elbow connectors laid out by depth, or an SVG a board here exported, which now carries the board inside it, so it comes back as shapes and connectors rather than a picture. Export adds Outline (Markdown: each frame a heading over what is in it, in reading order) and Mermaid (a flowchart of what the connectors join).
- Agent mode: the assistant edits boards (FEAT-12, WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 29). Seven new tools: move_board_item, edit_board_item (words, line colour, fill) and delete_board_item ask first, like every other tool that changes your work, and each returns an Undo (a delete takes the item's connectors and its Undo puts both back); add_board_shape draws a rectangle, ellipse, diamond or frame; list_library and place_library_item search the board's object library and place from it. 65 tools in all.
- Whiteboard: the mind map's Outline tab lists the map's topics as an indented tree in sibling order (Enter selects one on the map, Left goes to its parent); it was an empty tab. And an open Layers, Pages or Outline tab now follows the board as it changes, where before it showed the board as it was when the tab opened.
- Whiteboard: Pages and the hover lock. The sidebar's new Pages tab lists the board's frames in presentation order (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 22: frames are the pages); drag a row or press Alt+Up and Alt+Down to reorder, which the presentation follows, Enter goes to the frame and P presents from it. A locked item now shows a faded lock while the pointer is on it, the first press on one says how to unlock it, and right-click on it offers Unlock this item first (INBOX 557a).
- Whiteboard: every control on a selection's bar sits on one centre line. The Width box sat higher than everything beside it (the app's field margin, which the Size box had turned off for itself alone); now no number field on the bar carries a margin (INBOX 576).
- Whiteboard: a Format panel, like draw.io's. Ctrl+Shift+P on a board (or Format panel in the selection's More menu, or View) opens it on the right with three tabs: Style (line, width, pattern, fill, opacity, shadow, and a connector's line shape, ends and label place), Text (size, colour, bold, italic and alignment of a text box or of the words in a shape) and Arrange (X, Y, width, height and angle as numbers, flip, and the order, align, spacing, group and lock buttons from the board's command table). Every change is one undo step.
- Whiteboard: elbow connectors. A connector's line shape (the bar's new Line shape, or the Format panel) can be curved, straight or elbow; an elbow turns only at right angles and goes round the two shapes it joins, a ring in the middle of each run drags in a bend, a bend drags or double-clicks away, and placed library items keep their bends. A connector's label slides along its line by the square at its edge. New ends: the entity-relationship marks (one, one and only one, zero or one, many, one or many, zero or many). With one shape or text box selected, the arrows round it (or Alt+Shift and an arrow) copy it that way and join the two. A selected connector now shows its bar, which it never did, and the bar keeps clear of the sidebar's rail.
- Whiteboard: an object library, like draw.io's (INBOX 557, 558). The board's new sidebar (the Library button, or the rail on the board's left edge) has the Library, the Notes to drag in as cards, and the Layers. The Library holds built-in sets drawn for this app (General shapes, Flowchart, Arrows, Frames such as Kanban, a retrospective, SWOT and a timeline lane, and 1,530 icons drawn as shapes so they export), with search, Favourites and Recent; click or Enter places a tile in the middle of the view, a drag puts it anywhere, Shift+Enter places it joined to the selection, and placing is one undo step. Save your own with Ctrl+Shift+S or right-click, Library: a selection with its links, a drawn shape, a style, a sticky or text preset, a palette of the selection's colours, a mind map branch, or Board, Save this board as a template; New board then opens a gallery of Blank, the built-in frames and your templates. Libraries export to a file and import with new ids; a picture not in this notebook is left out and counted. A placed item is an ordinary copy: a later change to the library never changes a board. Library pictures and board backgrounds are kept by media cleanup.
- Whiteboard: Layers. The sidebar's Layers tab lists everything on the board in paint order, cards and text above the drawings, groups with their members; each row hides or shows (H), locks (L), renames (F2) and restacks by drag or Alt+Up and Alt+Down, and Enter selects it and brings it on screen. A hidden item is drawn nowhere, exported nowhere and skipped by search, Select all and Tab.
- Whiteboard and mind map comments: a thread shows its comments and a quiet New comment button under them, which opens the box with Post and Cancel; Escape or Cancel folds it away, and it folds back after a post. A thread with no comments yet opens straight on the box (INBOX 570).
- Whiteboard: paste text from any other app onto a board. A link becomes a link box, one line a text box, and several lines (a list, a column from a spreadsheet) a grid of stickies, selected and undone in one step; a picture pastes as before. Items copied on a board also reach the system clipboard as their words, so they paste into other apps (FEAT-09).
- Whiteboard export: a PNG (or a copy to the image library) can be 1x, 2x or 3x the board's size, 2x by default, and can have a transparent background; the choice is remembered. Exported files are named after the board ("Launch plan.png", "Launch plan (selection).svg") instead of whiteboard-whole.png, and the PDF's print dialog offers the board's name (FEAT-14).
- Whiteboard: a board's background colour and image are kept with the board, so they show the same in the desktop window, every browser and a backup, and Ctrl+Z undoes a change. Each board had shared one colour per browser, and the image was per browser too and was deleted by "clean up orphaned media"; a background set the old way moves onto its board the first time it is opened (FEAT-06).
- Whiteboard help, redesigned (INBOX 566): "?" on a board, Board, Keys and controls, or the empty board's card opens one sheet of every key and gesture, in sections (Tools, Move around, Select and edit, Arrange, View, and Mind map on a map), with a search field; each row's words wrap beside a fixed column of key caps, so nothing overlaps or runs off the card at any width (measured at 1440, 1024 and 390, light and dark). The empty board's card is one line and a button instead of the key list that overflowed it.
- Whiteboard: Bring forward and Send backward move one step (past the next item over or under it) instead of jumping to the front or back; Ctrl+] and Ctrl+[ bring to the front and send to the back, and a shape's order is now the order it is drawn in. The Arrange menu has all four, plus Same width, Same height, Group, Ungroup, Lock and Unlock all; Edit has Cut, Copy, Paste, Find, the item's text and Comment. Every board action is in the command palette (Ctrl+K, "This board") and in the shortcut sheet (?), from one table, so the words and keys agree everywhere (FEAT-07, FEAT-11, FEAT-19).

- Line numbers, in Capture, the note edit form and the documents editor: no boxed column any more. The figures sit in the field's margin, a size under the text, muted and of one width, each on its line's baseline, and the line the caret is on is brighter while you type; a note box numbers its own lines once its editor opens, so a wrapped line keeps one number (INBOX 590).
- Dashboard, Quick access: the first tile is highlighted by its position, not because it is New note, so whatever you put first is the one marked. Each tile's menu (Customise, Edit quick access) has Highlight: the accent, one of the twelve category colours, or No highlight; the choice is stored per user and Reset quick access clears it. Label and description keep 4.5:1 on every colour in both themes (INBOX 589).
- Notifications: a pop-up's message and its button are one row with an 8px gap and one centre line (the reading toast's Show it touched its words, 0px), toasts are 24rem wide so a short message and its button fit one line, and every pop-up with a button (Undo, Open it, Show it, Go to it, Change) is kept in the bell with the same button: an opener finds its note, chat, document or board again by id after a restart, an Undo works only while it can still be undone and then says Expired. Each bell row is one grid: the unread dot (now in every look), the icon, the text, and the time where the read circle and remove cross appear on hover, all on the title's centre line (the controls sat 4px low and over the text) with 8px padding on every side (INBOX 584, 585).
- The companion never sits on the air: when what it was sitting on, standing on or hanging from goes (a sub-tab's toolbar hidden with its view, a board or mind map panned or zoomed under it, a card redrawn), it moves to the nearest good perch within a moment, and what is drawn on a board, a map or the graph is never a perch. Before, on a mind map it stayed seated in the middle of the canvas after a zoom, and on the Library's AI skills on a toolbar that was no longer there (INBOX 582).
- The companion's small animations hold still for the 400ms a tab or Settings takes to arrive, so the page's frames come first (INBOX 580).
- Moving around the app is smoother: a tab arrives from 0.4 rather than from nothing (every switch used to show the bare window for three or four frames), every popup (Settings, the palettes, Find anything, a confirm) fades its backdrop in and rises a step into place, and the Graph, Library and Documents show one placeholder the size of the page while their code loads the first time, then fade in whole. Late parts no longer push the page: the Library's Images and Files empty line waits with the placeholders (it jumped 396px down and back on every switch), Chat's empty card waits for its starters, the Timeline's day strip keeps its height, and Settings' model line says Checking the models… until it knows (INBOX 580).
- Opening the app is one calm sequence: the splash (or the lock screen, once the password is in, its button saying Opening…) stays up while the first tab draws and then fades once over a finished page, never longer than 1.5 seconds. Before, the splash cut out without its fade (and stayed in the page), the status bar jumped from under the header to the foot, and the dashboard's greeting, clock and line about your notebook pushed the page down twice as they arrived. The companion comes in after the curtain lifts, at its own size: its entrances no longer squash or grow it, and Atlas's hello nod no longer draws its head a third larger for a moment (the large, small, large the owner saw at every start; INBOX 577).
- Mind maps: adding a topic with Tab or Enter is quicker on a big map (the redraw of one add at 300 topics went from 120 to 420ms to 20 to 60ms here); the name opens for typing before the rest of the map shifts, and a hidden style rule that restyled every icon in the app on each change is gone (audit FEAT-02, second pass).
- Concept maps: a topic made with Tab or Enter (and a new map's root) is still a note that search and Ask find, but Notes and Recently added leave it out, so a forty-topic map no longer puts forty one-word rows at the top of both; the board picker counts what is on the board and keeps the count current as you add (a map counts topics), the Library and the dashboard say links rather than sketches for the lines between cards, and after Enter names a card, typing renames it instead of picking tools (UX-06, audit 2026-10-05).
- Library: opening the Library tab fetches only the Library's own code; the document editor, the whiteboard and the graph library (about 900 KB gzipped) come with the first document or board you open, or the Boards sub-tab.
- Layout: the six rules that switched at 900px wide (the header's space name and mark, the chat's answer and records columns, the writing room's two boxes, the documents layout) switch at 820px with the rest of the tablet layout, so a window between 820 and 900 keeps the desktop header.
- Design checks: the button census is now a sweep that fails when a kind of button (icon-only, ghost, filled, segment, tab, chip) shows up at a height it has not had before, naming the control.
- Code health: a lint finds every GET that returns a list (or a dict holding one) by what it returns, not by its name, and makes it take a page or say why its size does not grow; On this day reads the five notes it shows instead of every match.
- Code health: the agent's tool dispatch, the app's start-up, the chat stream and the agent's wrap-up round are split into named steps with no change in behaviour (the longest went from 455, 354 and 334 lines to 302, about 80 and under 270).
- Code health: the event spec's per-write drivers, the skill harness's folded run and the filing prompt seam moved from the app's modules into tests/ (about 290 lines the app shipped and never called), and an unused timeline cursor encoder is gone.
- Startup: the graph library (d3) loads with the Graph tab or the Library instead of before the lock screen, and the app's emblem draws on a plain canvas, so the 1 MB p5 library loads only for the dashboard's art widget (about 330 KB gzipped off every launch).
- Notes: a card's category, Add tags and references chips take a click 2px above and below the chip as well, so each is a 28px target on a desktop while it still looks 24px tall.
- Suggested links: a note's name is read only for the notes a suggestion names (1.08 s to 371 ms warm at 5,000 notes).
- Graph: opening the map again with nothing changed reuses the last picture instead of rebuilding it (737 to 149 ms at 5,000 notes); a pin, a visit count, an attachment, a note put on a map, a link's reason or locking the vault still rebuilds it.
- Editing a note: the save returns before its new text is embedded for search by meaning; the vector is made a moment later on the model's own queue, from the newest text if you kept typing (a real embedding model took 200 to 400 ms of every autosave).
- Speed at 5,000 notes: a page of reference counts reads only the notes the search index says hold a long label's words (1,112 to 214 ms); the Timeline sends its rows once, not twice, and counts its days in the database (323 to 163 KB, 132 to 100 ms); Find duplicates on a notebook of a few hundred common words compares notes by one matrix product instead of pair by pair (about 160 s to 4 to 7 s) and sends each note's first 1,000 characters rather than the whole text; Library previews read at most the first 4,000 characters of a note.
- Checks: an animated `filter` or backdrop blur now has to say why above it, as an animated layout property already did (it repaints everything under the surface each frame); the graph node's hover glow, the one there is, says so.
- The '?' in the Suggestions, Manage tags and Manage categories sheets opens its explanation again (it did nothing: the sheet was built after the page's '?' buttons were wired). Escape closes an open explanation first and the sheet on the next press.
- Whiteboard: a frame's title can be grabbed at any zoom. Zoomed out to fit a phone it was about 7px tall and a drag aimed at it moved nothing; its hit area now stays at least a touch target tall on screen (44px at the fitted zoom), and the frame, what is inside it and anything selected move together by one amount.
- More deletes have Undo, from their toast and from the status bar (undo-1005): a reference removed from a note you are editing (it comes back in its place in the list), a note type (with its id and fields), a kind of link (with its key, and every link it was on typed again unless you have given that link another kind since), a chat (whole: its turns, pin, archive and dates) and a space that was empty or whose contents were moved to another (every moved row goes back, and a category merged into the other space is made again with its notes). Deleting a space together with everything in it stays final. Deleting a kind of link now clears it from links in every space, not only the open one.
- Chat, Web panel: each result's snippet marks the words the search was for (the query's own words without the little ones), built as text nodes so a snippet is never parsed as markup, with the same accent wash a note card's search match uses (BACKLOG section 13).
- Library, Documents: the more menu has Import a file as a document, which turns a Word file, PDF, spreadsheet, Markdown or code file into an editable document through the existing import route, redraws the list and names any file it could not read; the '?', the Guide's import topic and `tests/test_library_docs_import.py` say so (BACKLOG section 99).
- Settings, Web search: the '?' now lists what the code does with a search (a browser-like request that never names the app, no cookies kept between searches, the words sent in the request body and not the address, tracking parameters stripped from results, a self-hosted engine keeping the words on your network), and `tests/test_websearch_privacy_copy.py` holds each claim against the module (BACKLOG section 13).
- Search: the startup backfill and the Settings re-index embed notes in batches of 16 through one batched encode (`EmbeddingService.store_for_entries`) instead of one note at a time, and check for a cancel between batches; the stored vectors are identical (BACKLOG section 11).
- Docs: BACKLOG.md swept against the code: 97 open items struck as built with their file and line, 3 recorded as decided, 44 whiteboard, documents, graph and harness items pointed at their plans, and 93 given a one-line Next brief or marked as the owner's call; four small ones were built in the same pass (the Web search '?', batched embeddings, Import a file as a document, highlighted web snippets).
- Agent mode: asking for notes from "this week", "since Friday" or "last month" is counted by the app on your calendar rather than worked out by the model; an edit says what changed and which category the note is still in, so the answer cannot claim a move that did not happen; a note filed under a category you already have is never offered a tool that renames or merges categories; "added to Favourites" is understood as the pin it is rather than flagged as an unsaved note. The Daily review skill no longer spends a step reading the clock.
- Notes: Capture counts words and reading time instead of characters; Write with Atlas counts the words in each pane and sets the draft in the same font as your thoughts; Escape clears the Ask question (INBOX 63).
- Chat and Ask: hovering a citation number now also says which words it matched on, so a number pointing at the wrong note shows the wrong words (INBOX 76). Settings, Tools it can use: the list is grouped as Reads your notebook, Changes your notebook, Asks you first and Reaches the web (INBOX 71).
- Agent mode: every change the assistant makes is checked before and after. A link to a note that does not exist, a retag that changes nothing, or a category that is a misspelling of one you have ("Heath" beside "Health") is refused with a line saying what to use instead, and the notes are read back after each change so a change that did not hold is reported as not done rather than claimed (row 19). Removing a tag now works whatever its case. With Ollama, a small model's first round on an instruction is decoded as a tool call, as it already was with llama.cpp.
- Under the hood (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN F1, F5, F12): every saved setting is read through one module that never throws on blocked or damaged browser storage and never hands a page a value of the wrong shape (a number that is not a number was how a missing setting once flattened every card); every request to the app goes through one door, so the chat, Guide and log streams, every upload and import, and the exports carry the same sign-in, space and error handling; the notes list has one owner the dashboard waits for instead of loading the same notes twice, and it pages by the server's cursor so a note saved during a long load is not listed twice.
- Files (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN F10): every reading of a file (its caption, the OCR text, the vision model's reading and each page read in the OCR workspace) is one `readings` view and one route, `GET /files/readings`, and all of it is searchable: an upload read by the vision model, and any page read page by page, could not be found by its words before. Background work (F7): re-indexing the notebook runs on the job pool in a lane of its own, so it no longer holds captions and the filing of new notes behind it.
- Speed (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 19.3, 19.5): the whole `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` pass at 5,000 notes. In the All spaces view (the default) every list sorted its whole table, because each list index led with the space; twelve indexes on the lists' own orders take the sort away (the Library's activity 76.6 to 4.4 ms, the Timeline's page 35.8 to 0.2 ms, the Library's notes 36 to 0.2 ms). The activity panel lists the next ten waiting jobs of each kind and counts the rest in one row, so dropping 2,000 pictures no longer makes every poll 2,000 rows (347 KB).
- Skills and other agents (B8, H4): a Markdown file saved in the notebook's skills folder is a skill, listed in Settings, Skills and the chat's Skills menu the next time it opens, without a restart (the file's name is the skill's name, a "## Steps" list its steps, front matter its description, tools and inputs), and Settings says which files did not load and why. The API is also served under `/api/v1` behind the same unlock, and a change made by an outside agent (an MCP client, or a request naming itself in `X-MemoryMap-Agent`) is filed under that agent's name in History and the activity list, not as yours or Atlas's.
- API contract (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN B7): every paged list takes a `cursor` and answers with `X-Next-Cursor` while there is more, `offset` paging unchanged; the notes list's cursor is a keyset, so a note saved between two pages neither repeats a row nor hides one. A note read carries an `ETag`, and an edit or delete sent with `If-Match` for a version that is no longer current is refused with 412 and the current note, so an outside client cannot overwrite a change it never saw. `GET /capabilities` says what this install has (the transcriber, Tesseract, the Office importer, the embedding backend, the API version).
- Settings, Search index: the search engine's problem line is a warning notice with its icon. Settings, Models: an address you set that nothing answers says so (Nothing answered at the address, check it) instead of the server isn't running. An available update says how big its download is before you press Update. Suggested links: Link all above 70% says one thing for the lot.
- Documents on a narrow window: the Edit/Read segment's well grows to the 44px touch height its buttons take, so they no longer hang out of its foot and sit on the row's centre line (INBOX 568).
- Search and the local model (audit 2026-10-05): the finder and the palette find a note by meaning when no word matches, and through a typo ("gardn"), not only by keyword (ARCH-07, `tests/test_search_recall.py`). Background model work (captions, vision reading, filing jobs, the night and entity passes) waits between its calls while a chat answer streams, so a question waits at most for the one call in flight; follow-up suggestions are not asked for while the next question is already streaming (ARCH-09, ARCH-16 in part, `tests/test_model_gate.py`). A model server that is off fails within 5 s of connecting instead of after 10 minutes (ARCH-17). The context budget counts Chinese, Japanese and Korean text as about a token a character, so a CJK notebook no longer overfills the window and loses the system prompt (ARCH-15). Link suggestions and tensions keep each note's 12 best pairs, not every pair over the threshold (ARCH-11). Import cycles stepped round with `importlib` are counted by a ratchet lint, `tests/test_import_module_cycles.py` (ARCH-10).
- API and data safety (audit 2026-10-05): `GET /entries` also pages by a cursor (`after`, `X-Next-Cursor`), so a note saved during the read neither repeats nor hides one; offsets still work and the client's switch is the frontend audit's FE-05 (ARCH-04). A request that does not validate answers the app's one error shape, a sentence, `code: invalid` and the fields, and never echoes what was sent; it echoed a password sent as a list (ARCH-12). The bin purge, the event-log compaction and the daily backup start on a thread once the server answers, not before the port opens (ARCH-19). A note sent twice by the offline queue is one note across a restart and two resends at once: `client_key` is a column with a unique index (ARCH-23, migration `a7d3e9c1f5b2`). Library's activity honours the search and the space and no longer loads whole audit rows (ARCH-24). `/export/backup` is an SQLite snapshot, the write-ahead log included, and carries `uploads/` (every attachment) beside `media/`; before, the newest notes and every attachment were missing (ARCH-18). `/graph` and `/changelog` are encoded on the worker thread, not the event loop (ARCH-14, ARCH-25).
- People and things: merging two names has Undo, in the toast and on the undo stack, from an entity's page and from Suggestions, Names. Undo splits them back exactly: both names, their kinds and other names, every mention on the side it came from (the same rows, a dropped duplicate written back), and anything an earlier merge pointed at the folded name; Redo merges again (INBOX 553(a), `POST /entities/merges/{id}/undo`, `tests/test_entity_merge_undo.py`). Suggestions no longer loads every note to show a list (1.2 s at 5,000 notes for an empty one; audit ARCH-11).
- "All spaces", the default view, lists from indexes: the notes list, the bin, the archive, documents, reminders, chats and media had indexes only for one selected space, so with All spaces SQLite sorted the whole table on every page (measured with EXPLAIN on the real statements; the chat list's pinned-first order sorted in a space too). The audit log is indexed by action and by date for the corrections and the Library's activity (audit ARCH-05, `tests/test_all_spaces_indexes.py`).
- Saving a note no longer reads the notebook. Filing by your notebook's words and the kept tag suggestions use a corpus kept between saves and brought up to date by what changed (only edited notes are read and tokenised again), and filing by meaning takes its vectors from the search engine's matrix instead of decoding every stored vector; measured with embeddings up and no chat model, 400-word note, 5,000 notes: 4,300 ms p50 before, 390 to 615 ms after on a machine at load 10 to 13 (61 to 96 ms at 500 notes); `tests/test_save_cost_flat.py` holds the per-save work to a bound. Re-filing a note by hand now teaches filing with no model: two moves out of a category keep notes like it out of that category (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I7's consumer, claimed built and unwired; the re-files `update_entry` records were also invisible to it). Private notes no longer feed the words filing learns from (audit ARCH-02, ARCH-08, ARCH-20). Search: `GET /search` (the finder and the palette) keeps to the space it is asked in, and "All spaces" leaves out spaces hidden from it (audit ARCH-03, `tests/test_search_spaces.py`).
- Settings, Models: switching the chat backend keeps semantic search. The embedding service is re-pointed at the new client instead of rebuilt, so a loaded embedding model stays loaded (measured before: `embedding_ready` false and search keyword only until the next save, which then paid the 5 s cold load; audit ARCH-06, `tests/test_backend_switch_keeps_embeddings.py`).
- Saving while the night pass or the entity pass is asking the model no longer fails: both passes commit before every model call and write each note in a short transaction of its own (measured before: every save during Run now answered 500 after 5.1 s, the busy timeout). A write that does lose the race answers 503 "The notebook is busy for a moment. Try again." instead of Something went wrong (audit ARCH-01, `tests/test_write_lock_during_passes.py`).
- Layout (audit FE-11, FE-14, FE-19): a window exactly 600 or 720 pixels wide no longer gets both the narrow and the wide rules; the view toggles in every bar and a document's Edit and Read are the 28 pixel minimum tall (they were 24); the sidebar opener below 820 pixels is no longer cut off at the window's left edge; a Timeline row's cut-off preview shows in full on hover.
- Failed actions are reported (audit FE-12): forgetting a memory, deleting a backup, pinning or deleting a question, clearing history or the server log, redoing a delete and deleting finished reminders now say why when they fail, and a contradiction is only reported linked or dismissed when it was. The dashboard and reminders read the server's times as UTC, as the rest of the app does (FE-16).
- Reminders and the clear buttons (audit FE-08, FE-18): locking and unlocking no longer stacks another reminder poll each time (after four cycles an idle minute asked for reminders five times), and the clear buttons in Capture, Ask, Chat and the palettes follow their boxes without a once-a-second poll.
- Graph (audit FE-04): a big map's layout ends. Past 1,500 notes it cools in 120 ticks instead of about 300, and any layout stops 20 seconds after the last thing that moved it (a drag or a reheat starts it again), where a 5,000-note map was still moving after 30 s with the tab at 44% of the main thread. A node under 4 pixels across on screen is drawn as one batched dot per colour instead of its sprite (4,983 of 5,001 at the fitted view); zoomed in, every node keeps its sprite.
- Notes (audit FE-05): saving, binning, undoing, editing, publishing a draft, linking and a note's filing finishing re-read only the notes they touched (one GET /entries?ids= request) and patch them into the list, instead of re-reading the whole notebook. Measured at 5,000 notes: a save was 26 list requests and 16 s under load, now one 1-note request; the list, its count and the sidebar follow, and a patched list that disagrees with the server's count falls back to the full read. The list's clamp check measures every note before changing any.
- Library (audit FE-03): opening the Library no longer starts the grammar checker. The load-time paint of an empty editor fetched the 15.9 MB grammar WASM, its worker and the 871 KB word list on every first visit; they now load when a document with text is opened (measured: Library visit fetches none of them; opening a document fetches all three and finds its mistakes).
- Launch cost (audit FE-01, FE-02): the app's own scripts, stylesheets and page are served with their comments stripped (the files on disk keep them; a scanner, not a regex, proven by identical acorn token streams over every script), and each asset URL is stamped with a hash of its own file instead of a per-launch token. A relaunch now takes all 49 boot assets from the browser's cache (was 0 of 49); an edited file is still a new URL on the next page load. A cold load's assets went from about 2.4 MB to 772 KB; the app's 25 boot scripts from 792 to 329 KB gzipped. The grammar checker's WASM is gzipped once per version (8 MB instead of 15.9 MB on the wire).
- Small things from the 2026-10-05 UX audit: on a phone a note's category reads whole (the time drops " · edited" first) (UX-13); no menu item shows a tooltip reading "undefined" (UX-14); the Guide sends you to Settings, Import & export, and every Guide badge names its Settings section as the nav does (UX-15); the Library says "words in documents" (UX-16); the status bar says "Notebook ready · AI off" and the first save with no model says it is filed by your other notes (UX-17); the notes dock stays under the sub-tabs as the list scrolls, on a wider screen (UX-18); Highlight in a colour offers the colours to pick (UX-19); the bin is "the bin" everywhere, with a glossary in DESIGN.md (UX-20); the Create dialog shows Ctrl+Shift chords only in the desktop window, where a browser does not take them (UX-21).
- Status labels app-wide ("Built-in", "Installed", "In use for chat", a file's "Read · N words") are a tinted pill without an edge, matching the meta chips; their tone is the tint (INBOX 553 (c)).
- Settings, Import & export: a download says so in a toast, the Recent exports list says where browser downloads go and refreshes after a desktop save, and the export and backup groups each say in one line what they are for; Dashboard, Weekly digest: with no model, a line under the button says why it is off, with the Settings link, where only a tooltip did (audit 2026-10-05, UX-11, UX-12).
- Notes: the Connections column follows the note you are reading: the card you click, or else the one in view as you scroll, which wears a thin accent line at its left; the More menu's switch reads "Connections beside the note you're reading" (INBOX 571).
- Notes list: Tab walks the controls of one card, the one the arrow keys are on, and then leaves the list; 27 notes were 281 Tab stops, now the card's own five to seven (audit 2026-10-05, UX-10).
- Notes, Ask and the Guide: a selected question no longer brings up the writing popup (Highlight, Bold) over the tab bar after it is asked (audit 2026-10-05, UX-09).
- Command palette (Ctrl+K): rows for the recycle bin (it opens the Library with Include the bin ticked), Questions, Ask, Undo and Redo, and each row answers to the words people type for it ("trash", "deleted", "backup", "restore", "theme"), where those found nothing (audit 2026-10-05, UX-08).
- Ask and the agent: the status bar's wand says Agent, the name of the dialog it opens; with no model, Chat's suggestions say they open in Notes, Ask; the first starter is "What have I saved recently?", which Ask answers from the newest notes with no model (audit 2026-10-05, UX-07).
- Library, Create: New mind map is a row of its own (it opens the board dialog on Mind map), and New concept map says what it makes, a board of note cards whose topics are saved as notes, instead of calling itself a mind map (audit 2026-10-05, UX-06, in part).
- Documents: Enter (or Down at the end) in the title moves to the start of the body, as other editors do, from Read view too; it used to type the first line into the title (audit 2026-10-05, UX-05).
- Search: a one-letter typo that finds nothing is searched as the nearest word in your notes, in Find anything (Ctrl+P) and Filter notes alike, and each says "showing results for" the word; Find anything no longer tells a notebook with notes that nothing is indexed yet when a search has no hits (audit 2026-10-05, UX-04).
- Timeline and note cards: a day a note mentions sits on that day in every timezone (it was served as UTC midnight, so "on Friday" sat under Thursday 8:00 PM in New York) and reads All day; a time said with the day ("on Friday at 3pm") is kept and shown as written (audit 2026-10-05, UX-02).
- Reminders: Magic add reads wall-clock times with no AI ("call mum tomorrow at 5pm", "dentist next Friday at 3pm", "pay rent on 1 November", "water plants tonight", "high priority"), so the dashboard's Remind me works on the default install; the wand is no longer disabled without a model, and the AI is asked only for a phrasing the rules miss (audit 2026-10-05, UX-01).
- Mind maps: Write as a document (the board menu, or the command palette) turns a map into a new document: the central topic is its title, branches are headings, deeper topics lists, a topic's note the paragraph under it, and a card of the map at the top leads back to it.
- Documents: a page break. The / menu's Page break (written \newpage on its own line) shows as a labelled dashed line, and what follows starts on a new page when you print, save as a PDF or download the HTML.
- Dashboard: the Boards & maps widget draws the board or map with the most on it large, at its own shape: a small map at a readable size, a tall one in a taller card up to a limit and then fitted whole, its name under it, then the next four as rows (INBOX 553(d)).
- Documents: a hidden formatting toolbar is easy to bring back: a Formatting button sits in the document's bar while it is hidden, Ctrl+Shift+X shows or hides it, the ⋯ menu says Show formatting toolbar, and the first time you hide it a note says where it went (INBOX 574).
- Boards and mind maps: the cross-link tool's anchor dots no longer stay on a topic after you switch back to Select; deselecting, Undo, a tab switch or closing a menu clears them (INBOX 573).
- Mind maps: a topic you have dragged into place (pinned, drawn with a dashed box) keeps the Edge bar the Shape menu says: a Solid bar is solid again instead of dashed like the box (INBOX 569).
- Boards, mind maps and documents: Undo and Redo survive a reload. Each board, map and document keeps its last 100 steps on this computer, so closing the desktop window or reloading no longer takes Ctrl+Z away; locking the notebook clears them (INBOX 553(b)).
- Mind maps: paste an indented or bulleted list (from a note, a document or another app) onto a selected topic and it becomes that topic's branch, one topic per line, nested by indentation; one Ctrl+Z takes it back (audit FEAT-09, the map half).
- Mind maps: Tab and Enter open the new topic for typing at once instead of after the server and two redraws of the whole map (median 1,279ms to 320ms at 301 topics, measured back to back on the test box); a new topic and the name typed into it are one Undo step; after a name is committed the keys stay on the map and the name is read out; a laid-out map's topic menu no longer offers Bring to front and Send to back; and with a map open the command palette lists its commands (add, rename, fold, focus, tidy, layout, look, numbering, present, export). App-wide: three style rules that made every change to the page restyle all of it are rewritten (audit FEAT-02, 11, 15, 16, 17).
- Documents: pasting from a web page, Word or Google Docs keeps the headings, bold and italics, lists, quotes, code and links (as Markdown) instead of flattening them to plain text; a link with an unsafe address keeps its words only, a code editor's copy stays plain, and Ctrl+Shift+V pastes plain text (audit FEAT-04).
- Documents and notes: footnotes render in Read view, in a print or PDF and in the HTML export, not only in Live: `[^1]` is a raised number linked to its note, the notes are listed at the foot with a way back, and a comment exported as a footnote reads as one instead of as `[^c1]: remark` (audit FEAT-03).
- Mind maps: a FreeMind `.mm` file's central topic comes in as the central topic, not as the map's name, so a one-root map round-trips and a Freeplane or XMind map keeps its centre; OPML, FreeMind and Markdown each bring a 101-topic map back whole. An imported map, or one made from your notes, opens in the tree-right layout and laid out, instead of in Free where the first Tab piled topics on each other (audit FEAT-01, FEAT-05).
- Notes, Capture: the composer is one box; the note editor inside no longer draws its own border and focus ring a hair inside the composer's, and the composer's edge carries the focus (INBOX 560).
- Boards: the gesture hints' close button is pinned at the strip's end after a divider, whole and evenly inset, instead of clipped past the edge (INBOX 562).
- Dialogs: every dialog head is one row at every width, the title giving way with an ellipsis before its buttons would wrap onto a second line (measured on 42 heads at 390 and 1440; before, Where are my documents kept? and the dictionary put their X on a row of its own on a phone).
- Documents, the dictionary: one head row at every width (Dictionary, its '?', Import, Export and the X as icons), the count opening the line under it, the search-field well (its glyph used to sit on the placeholder), and the switch rows drawn as switch rows instead of a switch over a small grey label; on a phone the spelling choice goes under its name. Dialogs app-wide: an on/off row in a small dialog is no longer drawn as a form label.
- Documents, the Suggestions panel: one head row at every width (the name and its count, Fix N, Check with AI, a ⋯ with the Dictionary and the dock side, the X), measured one row down to the 240px right dock where it used to wrap; each finding is one row (the mark, the words over the reason in a narrow panel, then Accept and Ignore as quiet icons, Ignore last on every row), an opened row's answers sit under it rather than beside it, the candidates are quiet pills, Up and Down walk the rows and the focus moves to the next row after an Accept or Ignore; the empty state is one quiet line.
- Dialogs: How are these connected, Manage this connection, Manage bookmark groups, Review the map before it is made, Export this board and a map's facts and look open on the same head as every other dialog (a 16px title and an X), instead of a small uppercase heading or none; the link kinds are quiet rows with the chosen one tinted, and a map's facts lose the extra filled Close.
- Pickers: the dialogs that choose from your notebook (the mind map's Point a new node at, Add to a note, Make a map of these notes, Choose from your library) share one modern shell: a dialog head with its X, the search field with its glyph, and rows with an icon tile and the name over one line of facts (a note's category and when, a document's words, a file's size, a bookmark's site). Down and Up walk the rows and Enter takes one; the source tabs walk with the arrows and keep the list one height; the several-notes picker has the Attach picker's check rows and one filled button.
- Timeline: the calendar strip under the dock is one header row. The month sits between its two arrows, and the seven days are one well across the rest of the row (it was a 448px column of bordered boxes with the arrows 230px from the month); today's number is filled, a dot marks a day with a page, and the days are one Tab stop the arrow keys walk, past either end a day at a time. On a phone the arrows take the row's ends and each day stacks its weekday over its number (46px wide at 390).
- The app opens with 34 KB less script to download (gzipped, 792,754 to 758,418 bytes): the Settings window's own listeners, the catalogue's deep links, the welcome card, the update dialogs, the command palette's window, a note card's menu panels, the edit form's Similar and links panels and the put-on-a-board pickers now load the first time you use them. Nothing looks different; the first Settings open waits a few milliseconds for its file.
- A face's large view is alive (INBOX 591): its weight shifts, its head sways and its arms drift on clocks that never line up, and its eyes and head turn to the pointer, as the companion's do; still but for its blink and breath under reduced motion. Measured over 2s: 7 of 40 parts move (3 before).
- Atlas moves like a body (INBOX 540, 554, 556, 564, 575): each arm is a jointed chain, shoulder, elbow and wrist, that bends as one smooth outline, and every change of pose, act or mood eases there on springs timed by the size of the move (250 to 500ms), drawing back a little before a big one and settling past it, the shoulder a beat after the body, the elbow and the wrist after it; a wave lifts the forearm, the bell and the star map straighten the arm, folded and clasped arms bend at the elbow, and the arms swing in counter-phase while it travels; the head lags a change of pose and catches up; the hair trails the body's sway and a wave runs down both tails to the tip; the dress or cloak, the tails, the hair and the nebula stream each take a pose for what it is doing (resting, moving, sitting, lying, a gesture, thinking, happy, sad, startled), in a variant picked at random so repeats differ, blended with an overshoot and settle; his lower body is a cloak in her dress's celestial material; a blink is the lid coming down over the eye and back up, where a patch of skin with a heavy ink arc faded in and read as a thick brow; capped tips (the tails, his trail, the chin hand) are round instead of notched. With motion reduced, a pose changes at once and nothing idles.
- Atlas, the feminine look: the fringe is five tapered locks with round tips over a smooth hairline, drawn with the hair's cap so no mood can open a gap; the astral wisps are tapered ribbons in nebula hues that fade at both ends, wrap behind the body and back round the front, with four-point glints that twinkle; the lower body keeps its shape as a dress that dissolves into light and motes at its end, with no outline; her figure is slimmer, her long hair four broad flowing locks with soft curls in place of a fan of spikes, her comet tail longer and feathered like her wings, and she breathes, floats and trails her dress on clocks of their own (still under Reduce motion). Both looks have a smaller, oval head with softer eyes, and arms that hang relaxed from the shoulder with a soft bend at the elbow, gestures rising from there; the masculine torso tapers from broad shoulders instead of being an egg (INBOX 550, 554, 555, 556, 559, 563, 564, 565, 567, 568).
- Notes, Questions: Read notes now finds the questions your notes ask at once (the night pass, which otherwise runs only with background tasks on); the empty line says so (INBOX 551).
- Whiteboard: right-click a frame's title, Export this frame…, to export the frame and everything inside it (locked items too) as a picture, PDF or SVG. A frame inside another moves with it.
- Mind maps: View, Present branches shows a map full screen one branch at a time: the whole map first, then each branch fitted to the screen, with the same bar and keys as a board's Present frames (arrows, Space, Home, End; Escape puts everything back).
- Mind maps: boundaries and summaries. A topic's menu (More, Branch) draws a boundary round its branch, rounded, dashed or as a cloud, in the branch colour and with a label if you like, and it grows, folds and moves with the branch; Summarise puts a brace beside one topic, or beside several selected side by side, with your words past its tip. Both undo, survive OPML and FreeMind exports and come out in the picture exports.
- Whiteboard and mind maps: comments. Right-click a card, sticky, shape or topic and choose Comment… for a thread on it; a count on its corner opens the thread again, Enter posts, a trash deletes and Ctrl+Z takes either back. Kept with the item through moves, copies, undo and a duplicated board; not exported.
- Graph topics can be renamed: the pencil on a topic's card gives it a name of your own, kept by its notes so it follows the topic through small changes, and the arrow brings the found name back (PUT /graph/topics/name). Library, Contents has By topic, a section per topic (INBOX 547).
- More of the app has Undo (INBOX 537): merging duplicate notes (the words, tags and binned notes come back), generating or removing a note's title, changing a link's kind or properties, deleting several boards from the Library (they go to the recycle bin), and deleting a category from the keyboard. The audit of what has Undo and what does not is in WHITEBOARD_PLAN, "Undo coverage".
- Undo and redo on boards and maps cover every change (INBOX 537): each board, map and document keeps its own history for the session, and Ctrl+Z or the status bar's pair walks the open one (the app's own stack everywhere else). A map gesture (fold, theme, numbering, layout, tidy, detach, remove keeping the branch, turn a line around, copy a branch, clear the map, reset every topic's style) is one step read off what it changed; a deleted topic comes back with its branch and under its parent; a deleted card, box or shape comes back with its links; a deleted selection and Clear board are one step each; a picture's file is kept so its Undo shows it; a branch dropped on a folded topic opens it rather than vanishing; a rename left open across an Undo can no longer write onto another topic. Deleting a board moves it to the recycle bin with Undo. Clearing completed reminders, and deleting an overdue or done one, can be undone.
- Documents on a phone: in Read view the first line sits right under the head row (y=199 at 390x844, was 255): the document's name is not repeated as a heading under the row that already shows it, and the page's padding matches the card's. Desktop Read view still opens with the name.
- Atlas, on a small model: "What tags and what categories am I using?" (two questions in one sentence) is read as a question, so the tag and category tools that change things are not offered for it; filing a note under a category that already exists no longer opens by offering to create the category; and when a request that must open with a tool call gets prose instead, the model is asked once more to call it (`tests/test_toolwords.py`, `tests/test_harness_tiers.py`, `tests/test_harness_robustness.py`).
- Focus mode (the graph's local view): the neighbourhood of a note is drawn from an index of the notebook's connections that is kept until a note or link changes, instead of being rebuilt from every note on each open or refocus; measured on synthetic notebooks of 2,000 and 10,000 notes, a repeat call went from 129 ms and 1,032 ms to 13 ms and 23 ms (`tests/test_graph_local_scaling.py`).
- Atlas, on a small model (under 8B): when a request must open with a tool call, the first round is offered only the tools that act and the searches that find the note named, so "Add X to my note" no longer opens with the clock and "Put X in my shopping note" no longer makes a new note (measured on a 3B: a right first tool 17 of 22 before, 20 of 22 after). A question's first round is offered no tool that changes anything, and "File the note under Health" is offered the note edit that sets its category.
- Web search: pressing Start on SearXNG while a reinstall begins now stops at once and says it was being reinstalled, instead of waiting out three minutes and reporting that SearXNG wrote nothing.
- Dialogs show one filled button at a time: the Documents AI panel's Replace with this, the OCR workspace's Save changes, the meeting recorder's Save as a note and Settings' embedding fix take the fill only when their step arrives (the button before them goes quiet); About's Install this version and Change keyboard shortcuts are quiet buttons.
- Notes: the facts on a note's line (the dates it mentions, how sure the filing is, what points at it, reminders, a missing tag) no longer draw an outline, and the category chip lost its hairline; the ones you can press (the category, links, Add tags, the references count) still tone under the pointer.
- Timeline: the month above the calendar strip opens a month calendar to jump past the seven days. Arrow keys, Home, End and Page Up and Down walk it, Escape gives the focus back, days after today are off, a dot marks a day with a page, and picking a day moves the strip to it and focuses it (nothing is written).
- Help: the nine '?' buttons that still ran on the older hand-wired panel (Graph, Timeline, Notes' filter and capture, Skills, Boards, Media, Contents and Settings' search relevance) are the shared `data-help-for` popover now, and the Settings Logs dock has its own '?'. Same text, one code path; Escape on the Graph's '?' still leaves the map full screen. A lint fails if a hand-wired help panel comes back.
- Timeline: a calendar strip above the feed shows the last seven days with a dot under each that has a page; pressing a day opens its note or document, or starts it in the composer with the date as the title (nothing is written until you save), and the arrows move a week. A note titled with its date now shows the day before and the day after as buttons under its title. Ctrl+D shares the same lookup, which asks `GET /entries/daily` before reading so an empty day is not a 404 (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/daystrip.js`, `tests/test_daily_strip.py`).
- Dashboard and Reminders: each dock now ends with a '?' that opens a short note on the page (the Dashboard's search, widgets and layout; the Reminders groups, the plain-words box and the calendar export), the same button every other tab's dock has; `tests/test_dock_help_507.py` fails on a dock without one (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/dockhelp2.js`, 4 of 4 at 1440 and 390).
- Command palette: Ctrl+K now lists Open today's note, Go back, Go forward and Reload the app, the four shortcuts that had no row; `tests/test_consistency_contract.py` fails on a tab or a shortcut the palette lacks, a card in a card, a glass in a glass, a menu row that paints a fill at rest, and a second filled button in a modal or a settings pane (5 existing dialogs and 13 chip rules are held at their count).
- LAN mode answers over IPv6 as well as IPv4 where the computer has both: one dual-stack socket, so a phone on an IPv6 network can reach it too; the addresses Settings and the privacy receipt list include global and unique-local IPv6 ones in brackets (never link-local, which no browser can open).
- Notes, Questions: every question your notes ask in passing, newest first, as Open, Answered or Dropped with a count on each. An answered one quotes the later sentence that answered it and opens its note; Mark answered asks which note answers it and links the two; Drop and Reopen move it back and forth. Ask about these answers from the notes with open questions only, and the Dashboard's While you were away card names the oldest open question.
- Dashboard, While you were away: reading your notes on its own now also finds two claims in different notes that disagree (the rent is 900 in one and 950 in a later one) and a question a later note answers. Each row quotes the other sentence, opens the other note, and a disagreement can be linked as one; a dismissed pair is never found again. With no model it finds only a changed number or a 'not', and a later sentence that holds most of what the question asks.
- Search by meaning reads long notes paragraph by paragraph: a note of two or more paragraphs stores a vector per paragraph and scores on the better of its own and its best paragraph's, so a question about one paragraph of a long note finds it (seeded 1,000 notes: recall@5 0.01 to 0.42). Old long notes get paragraphs at the next launch; editing one paragraph re-embeds only that one.
- Chat and Ask: a source mark's preview says whether the passage supports the sentence or only partly, with three short bars for why it was chosen (Words, Meaning, Links). The end of Grounded in says how many sentences came from your notes and opens the evidence: each sentence beside the passage it came from, and No note says this beside the rest.
- Dashboard: Recent activity's "Undo what Atlas did" row goes once the undo has put everything back, instead of staying to say "Already undone"; a later change by Atlas brings it back (`GET /events` names the events a restore reversed).
- Dashboard: the While you were away card grows to fit the review list you open instead of scrolling inside a 320px box, so every finding and its Dismiss button can be reached; it still pages five at a time.
- Mind maps on a phone: a selected topic's add and link buttons hang below the topic instead of over the left of its label, so pressing the start of a topic's text selects it rather than adding a child.
- Privacy receipt: the ledger is written within a second of a connection instead of only when the receipt is opened and when the app quits, so an app that is killed or crashes no longer loses what it had seen (`tests/test_egress_ledger_writes.py` kills a process mid-run).
- Background work survives a quit or a crash: the readings and filings an upload starts (text from images, captions, vision reads, document reads, filing) are kept in the notebook while they wait, and the next launch finishes what was left, three tries at most. A queued reading can be stopped from the activity panel. New `GET /jobs`, the server-sent `GET /jobs/stream`, and `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN B2, `tests/test_jobstore.py`).
- Phone: a tap on a note in Select mode now only ticks it. It ticked the note and also opened its page over the list, so the next note could not be reached until Back was pressed. `tests/test_phone_select_mode_tap.py`, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/deepflows.js` (the select flow).
- Notes and documents: the `[[` picker offers the note you are naming first. It listed every note holding the words anywhere, newest first, cut to six, so with newer notes linking to "Alpha project" the picker's first row (the one Enter takes) was one of those and Alpha project itself was sixth or missing. Notes whose first line starts with the words come first, then ones whose first line holds them, then ones that only mention them. `tests/test_wiki_picker_ranking.py`.
- Settings, Models: the "Advanced response settings" heading no longer drops its "?" onto a second line at phone width (the head stood 71px tall in a 44px row, so the chevron and the "?" sat on different lines from the words); the heading wraps in place instead. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/deepflows.js` (fold headings, 0 of 21 sections spill at 390).
- Settings, Profile and General: a switch pressed and then left for another section within a second is no longer put back. Those sections save 700 ms after the last change, and opening one reloaded the old values over the form before that save ran, which then saved the old values. `tests/test_prefs_pending_save_survives_pane_switch.py`.
- Settings, Tools it can use: all 58 tools can now be switched off (the list held at most 50, so the 51st switch was refused and left looking off), and a refused save puts the switch back and says why instead of failing silently. `tests/test_agent_tools_api.py`, `tests/test_tool_switch_save.py`.
- Settings: pressing a setting's words now toggles its switch. On every row with a long hint the words opened the help instead (the "?" came first in the row, and a label activates its first control), so only the small switch itself worked. `tests/test_setting_label_toggles.py`.
- Dashboard: Recently added, the random-note widget and the unfinished-checklists list no longer print a note's `---` properties block as its words (`---` and the fields were the first thing shown for a note with properties). `tests/test_properties_never_in_previews.py`, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/deepflows.js`.
- Notes and documents: `[[Target|Shown]]` draws the shown words (it drew `Target|Shown`), opens the note or document named before the bar (it looked for one starting with the whole text and offered to create it), and a document's live view hides the target and bar like the brackets. Board references (`board:12|Title`) are unchanged. `tests/test_wiki_alias_frontend.py`.
- Phone: Edit on an open note now opens the edit form. The note page (a full-screen sheet) stayed over the form, which was drawn in the list behind it, so Edit seemed to do nothing until Back was pressed; starting an edit now puts the page away first. `tests/test_phone_note_page_edit.py`.
- Notes: in a note's edit form, Home, End and the up and down arrows now work in the title, tags and body fields. The notes list took those keys for moving between rows even from inside a field, so the caret never moved and the focus jumped to another note, and what was typed next was lost. `tests/test_entry_list_keys_in_fields.py`.
- Mind maps: the topic strip no longer opens over the handle that bends the line into the selected topic (it did for 4 of 48 topics at 1440, on a radial map's inner rings and a tree's last branch); it slides clear to one side or opens under the topic instead, 0 of 192 at 1440, 1024, 820 and 390 (MINDMAP_PLAN 13b; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mapstripcover.js`).
- Library, Boards and maps: each row of the New menu now says what it makes under its name ("An empty canvas you arrange by hand", "Topics branching from one central idea"), so the two kinds are told apart on a touch screen too, where a tooltip never shows (MINDMAP_PLAN INBOX 24; `.dock-menu-item-hint`, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/boardsnew.js`).
- Mind maps: View, How this map looks (was "How this map draws topics") now leads with the whole map's own two: Branch colours (Classic, Deep, Soft, Vivid) and Font (Serif, Monospace, Wide sans). The canvas and the Library thumbnail draw from one palette list on the server (`MAP_BRANCH_PALETTES`, sent with `/tree`), so they always agree, and the image export writes the map's font. On a map whose look sets a topic's box, bar, size, alignment or line, that topic's picker also offers the app's own default ("Rounded", "M"), which the topic then keeps against the map (MINDMAP_PLAN 13e, decisions 8 and 9; `tests/test_map_theme_palette.py`, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mappalette.js`).
- Documents: with `type: Meeting` in a document's properties, the panel shows the Meeting type's fields the document has not written yet as empty rows, each with the control its kind needs (text, number, date, list, yes/no, another note); a row left empty adds nothing to the file, and a value goes in as one new line above the closing fence, leaving the other lines as they were. It read no note types before. `docFrontmatterTypeFields`, `tests/test_doc_type_fields.py`, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/doctypeprops.js` (11/11 at 1440 and 390).
- Phone: a toast fired while a bottom sheet is open is drawn over it. A sheet opened from a menu or another high layer is drawn one layer above that opener (up to 2601), and the toast box was at 1050, so the confirmation of what the sheet had just done sat behind it; below 600px the box is now at 2700. Measured at 390x844 with `elementFromPoint` at the toast's centre: covered at openers of 1050 and above (4 of 8 layers tried), answered in all 8 now (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/toastsheet.js`, `tests/test_toast_over_sheets.py`).
- Agent: the link tool now takes a kind of link (`link_type`) and accepts the built-in kinds and your own relation types, by key or by name; its description lists what exists in this notebook, capped at 420 characters with a count of the rest, and an unknown kind is refused with the list. It took no kind before, though two prompts told the model to link with 'contradicts'. `tests/test_agent_link_types.py`.
- Notes: a note's `---` properties block no longer shows as its words in search snippets (and a result's title is the line after it, not `---`), the Library's note, bin, file and document card previews, a reminder's note line, a contradiction's excerpt, Ask cards, the agent's graph and whiteboard previews, the extractor's link previews, a remove-title and a generate-title (both left the block alone only by accident: the heading now goes after it), and five clips in the page (categories split list, graph remind, lightbox remind, similar-note row, the palette's note rows). `tests/test_properties_never_in_previews.py`.
- Lint: `tests/test_select_focus.py` fails a `.focus()` or key listener on a page `<select>` (enhanceSelect moves both to its opener); 0 offences today (DOCUMENTS_PLAN's 2026-09-09 batch).
- Documents on a phone: the status line (words, goal, suggestions) was drawn behind the formatting bar at the foot and never seen, and the editor stopped 72px above the bar with a blank band between; the page now ends where the bar begins (status line visible, writing down to it). The floating selection bar no longer repeats the foot bar's Bold, Italic, Heading and Link, so it fits a 390px window with Ask and Rewrite on screen (it ran 117px off the edge); on any other narrow surface it wraps rather than runs off. `docphonebar.js` (DOCUMENTS_PLAN 17 and 18's phone half, HISTORY "the documents phone pass").
- Documents: a task's checkbox is drawn at the text's size (it was a 28px square on a desktop and 44px on a phone, growing its line and overlapping the next task's), with its press area kept at the app's target size beside it; Read's (disabled) task boxes too. `doctaskbox.js`.
- Grammar check: a wiki link (`[[Another doc]]`) is no longer read as prose ("Use another on its own", offering "aNother"); a lint touching a link or an embed is dropped (`tests/test_prose_tools.py`).
- Whiteboard and graph: zooming with Ctrl and a mouse wheel moved one notch to about 1.4x instead of 5x (two notches used to take a map from its normal size to the 4x ceiling); a trackpad pinch and the graph's plain wheel zoom are unchanged (`zoomWheelDelta`, `tests/test_zoom_wheel_delta.py`, `ctrlwheelzoom.js`).
- Whiteboard: pictures on a board now appear in its exports. A PNG, a PDF and the copy added to your image library used to show an empty space where each picture was, and a saved .svg pointed at an address that only works inside the app; the pictures are now written into the file (`wbexportimage.js` sweep, `tests/test_wb_export_inline_images.py`).
- Notes: while Atlas writes into the draft on the Write with AI page, the draft box can no longer be typed into (the lock only reached the hidden textbox behind the editor, so you could edit text that was about to be overwritten; `tests/test_note_surface_readonly.py`).
- Notes: the formatting strip in a note's edit form listed each highlight and text colour twice (the copy of the capture strip kept its options and had them added again); each is listed once.
- Chat: scrolling up inside a code block, table or thinking fold in an answer no longer stops the chat following the writing; only a wheel the chat pane itself would scroll lets go (`nestedTakesWheelUp`, `tests/test_chat_scroll_534.py`).
- Timeline: the Auto bucket now picks the finest of day, week and month whose headers stay few (120 at most) and filled (a median of two items a header and under 60% of its calendar empty, once there is more than a screen of them), counted per scale instead of from active days: 3 months of a 2,077-note notebook reads by day (was week, 166 notes under one header), a sparse range reads by week (was day, 83% empty), two years of steady writing by week; no width scrolls sideways, worst first screen 51% empty, first paint is scale-independent (about 260ms on 2k notes in the sandbox). `timelineAutoScale`, `tests/test_timeline_auto_scale.py`, Guide text updated (TIMELINE_PLAN, HISTORY "the auto scale").
- Speed: two text patterns could stall on a long run of spaces (20,000 spaces took 5 to 7 seconds): the one that splits a model's follow-up suggestions and the one that spots a table's divider line when exporting a document to Word. Both are linear now (under 0.02 s) and split and match exactly as before.
- Duplicates: the scan is much faster and reads more of a large notebook. 60 notes went from about 196 ms to 8 to 15 ms; the scan used to give up after 500 notes (more than 25 s at that size) and now reads 5,000, so a notebook past 500 notes has its newer notes checked too (2,000 notes: about 0.7 s). Same groups and scores as before.
- Connections: in Mentioned, not linked, the Link button is greyed out (with the reason on hover) for a note whose opening line has a square bracket in it, such as "Plan [v2]". It used to say "Linked", rewrite the sentence and store no link, because a [[link]] cannot hold a bracket. Names with # or | ("C# basics") link as before.
- Privacy: what you search for no longer appears in the log. The access log, Settings log viewer and support bundle used to carry `GET /search?q=your words` in full; now the value of any query parameter that is not paging or a switch shows as `[redacted]` (the route and parameter names stay).
- Privacy: "Tag and file with Atlas" on a private note is refused (it used to send the note's text to the model, or ciphertext while locked, and to the search index); Atlas does not read private notes.
- Atlas: a tool argument typed as a number now refuses "nan" and "inf" (and any value too large to be a finite number) instead of passing them to the tool.
- Atlas: a model reply made of thousands of nested brackets no longer escapes the background passes that read model JSON (note splitting, filing, remembered facts, reminder parsing); the pass fails quietly like any unreadable reply.
- Privacy: opening a name (person, place, project) that only private notes ever mentioned now says it could not be found, as the list of names already did, instead of showing its name and aliases with no notes.
- Privacy: the properties on a link that touches a private note (the short values you add to a link) are now encrypted like its reason: readable while unlocked, absent while locked, sealed when a linked note goes private, restored when it goes public again, and moved onto the new key when the encryption key is rotated. They were stored in plain text before.
- Privacy: the reason on a link that touches a private note is now encrypted like the note and kept out of the activity log's text (you still read it while unlocked; it was stored in plain text before). Making a note private seals the reasons on its links, making it public again restores them, and rotating the encryption key now also moves a private note's history and link reasons onto the new key (they would have stopped opening). Tags stay visible on a private note by design.
- Agent: after pinning or editing a note, a new note that copies it (or that carries the app's own quoting marks from the prompt) is refused rather than made, which a 3B model did twice in ten everyday requests; and a model under 8B is offered the tool that saves a preference only when the request is about you ("remember", "from now on", "call me"), since "Note down ..." and "Save this ..." were saved as preferences (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM H4, INBOX 527).
- Agent: "Show me" a picture that a note already found holds is no longer offered the board and map tools at all (a 3B model put the note on a whiteboard instead of showing the picture); asking to add or place it on a board still offers them. A note made with tags no longer gets "Heads up: I said I tagged a note" when the answer says it was tagged (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM H4, INBOX 527).
- Atlas, feminine look: the astral wisps show on a light page (drawn in the nebula's deeper violet there; median contrast against what is behind them 1.13 before, 1.33 now, the brightest tenth 1.40 before and 3.28 now, as the dark theme's 3.24), the waist and tail wisps now turn with the tail in every pose (lying down they floated beside the body), and the body's edge glow carries on down the tail instead of ending at the hips. The masculine look is pixel-identical.
- Agent: what a turn asks of a model now comes from one table of three sizes, read from the model's name (under 3B, 3B to 8B, 8B and up; a name with no size is treated as large), in place of one under-8B switch. A model under 8B that writes on and on in a step where it could call a tool is cut short (about 600 tokens under 3B, twice that up to 8B) with a line saying so, where a 1.5B model once wrote for 948 s to the 2,048-token cap; note ids and match scores copied from the prompt ("(note id 3)", "similarity 0.54") come off the answer; and a picture question whose picture is in a note already found ("Show me the whiteboard sketch from the planning meeting") is no longer offered the board reading tools first, which a 1.5B model used instead of showing the picture (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM H3, INBOX 527).
- Agent: an answer is checked against what the turn read before it is final; a number (a count, a time, a date, an amount) or a name in it that no tool result, note or your own words contain gets a heads-up under the answer naming it, the way a claimed act that never ran already did. No second model round: on a twenty-answer set (twelve true), all twenty are called right and none of the true ones is flagged (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM H2, INBOX 527).
- Agent: a turn that takes more than one step now draws its own checklist above the answer, one row per round naming what it searched or read, ticked as each ends, then the answer; it is saved with the chat and shown again when the chat is reopened (it used to appear only for Plan first and skills, and a small model is never offered a plan). A skill run's checklist, which reopening a chat had been dropping, now comes back too (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM H1, INBOX 527).
- Atlas, feminine look: the Galaxy Seed Sower's body (INBOX 535, the owner: "I want the female bottom half and main body the feminine atlas to be more like this"). An hourglass torso (a small chest curve, a clear waist 0.73 of the chest and 0.55 of the hips, rounded hips) whose hips flow into one long, wide spectral tail sweeping out to one side and curling up to a soft point, as wide as the hips where it leaves them (over 80% of the hips where the torso fades into it, by the shape test), its inner side shaded the nebula's violet with galaxy sparkles; the comet tail is the second, thinner ribbon tail, now from the other hip. No gown, no ribbon tails, no waist band; fills only, nothing along either tail under 2px. The masculine look is pixel-identical.
- Chat: Atlas only shows a picture when your question is about one; it no longer adds pictures to unrelated answers.
- Graph: a Filter fold in the gear holds a chip per kind of link on the map (No kind, Supports, your own, each with its count): press one to take those links off the map and again to bring them back, kept between visits; and a chip per property value its notes carry (status: open, type: Meeting), which lights those notes (GRAPH_PLAN KG8, INBOX 528).
- Notes filter: live queries over the notebook's structure. `type:meeting`, `prop:status=open` (also `!=`, and `> >= < <=` on numbers and dates, or `prop:status` for any value), `links:[[Kiln plan]]`, `rel:supports` (a kind's key or either of its names), `entity:"Sam Lee"` (or an alias), with `-` before any to leave those out, mixed freely with the filter's words and `tag:`. A bar over the list says how many match and shows the same notes as a Table (their properties as columns) or lit on the graph; a saved filter keeps the query. `GET /entries/query` (`entry/query.py`) (GRAPH_PLAN KG7, INBOX 528).
- Notes: properties and note types. A note can carry properties at the top of its own text (`status: open`, between two `---` lines, as Obsidian writes them); the card shows them as a small table under the title and is still named by its heading. A note's ⋯ has Properties (add, change, remove, or pick a type; Save rewrites only those lines); Note types in the command palette makes a kind of note with fields (text, number, date, list, yes/no, another note) and a New note that starts with them. A vault's own frontmatter now imports as properties (category and tags still become the note's own), and a Markdown export writes one block. Properties are indexed for queries (`entry_properties`, never a private note's). `GET|PUT /entries/{id}/properties`, `/note-types`, migration d9b2e6f4a1c7 (GRAPH_PLAN KG4, INBOX 528).
- Links: a link can say what kind it is, and each kind has a name from the other end: Supports reads Supported by from the note it points at, and you can add your own (Part of / Has part, Cites / Cited by). A link's ⋯ has Kind and properties (pick a kind, make a new one, or give the link properties such as count: 4); its chip and the Connections rows name the kind from that note's end; Kinds of link in the command palette renames or deletes your own (their links stay, with no kind). Kinds and properties are in the database, so a backup keeps them, and the JSON export now carries each link's kind, reason and properties. `/relation-types`, `PATCH /entries/{id}/links/{link_id}` takes `props`, migration c3f7a9e2d5b8 (GRAPH_PLAN KG3, INBOX 528).
- Graph, Topic colour: a topic's legend entry opens its card (its name, how many notes, what they share) with Summarise, which asks your local model for one sentence about those notes, kept until one of them changes; Stop abandons the ask, and with no model the card says what the notes share instead. No note's name is placed over a topic's name plate any more. `POST /graph/topics/summary` (GRAPH_PLAN KG6, INBOX 528).
- People and things: every person, place, project, organisation or thing Atlas finds in your notes now has a kind and a page: click one on the graph, or open People and things from the command palette. The page shows each note that names it with the sentence (the name marked), what it is named with, and the dates its notes mention; its ⋯ sets the kind, renames it, edits its other names and merges it into another, every mention following. On the graph, two named together in two notes or more are joined by a dotted line. Extraction asks the model for a kind and lands an old or other name on the entity it now belongs to. `GET /entities`, `GET|PATCH /entities/{id}`, `POST /entities/{id}/merge` (GRAPH_PLAN KG5, INBOX 528).
- Suggestions: one sheet holds everything the notebook proposes and you decide, as four kinds with their counts: Links (the pairs Find links to add offered, with every reason), Tensions (the disagreement review, still started by hand), Names (one person or thing named two ways, "Sam" and "Sam Lee" or a near spelling; Merge moves every mention and keeps the other name as an alias, so extraction never makes it twice) and Link types (a link whose own sentence or reason says "for example", "continues", "evidence", "contradicts" or "background", with the words marked). It opens from Find links to add, the Graph's Suggest links, the Tensions widget and the command palette; it replaces the panel under the graph's toolbar and the Tensions dialog. Every accept and dismissal is a correction: a dismissed one never returns, and each kind of reason is trusted more or less from then on. A link accepted from its reasons keeps their confidence. `GET /suggestions`, `PATCH /entries/{id}/links/{link_id}` (a link's type), entities gain kind, aliases and merged_into (migration b8e4f2a6c9d1) (GRAPH_PLAN KG9, INBOX 528).
- Chat: pictures appear in an answer only when they answer or illustrate the point, or when you ask for one.
- Chat: the Attach panel draws over the chat's header instead of under it.
- Sub-tab bars stay readable over a scrolled page; Quick access rows no longer keep an empty strip for their hidden move buttons.
- Graph, Trace: each step of a route says how many other reasons its two notes relate ("linked to +2") and names them on hover: people or things both mention, a note both link with, a rare tag both carry; a step with a private note names none. `steps[].also` on `GET /graph/path` (GRAPH_PLAN KG8, INBOX 528).
- Graph: a Topic colour rule finds the subjects inside each cluster (two subjects joined by one link are one cluster and two topics), draws each topic's outline with its name on a plate above it, and names it by the tag, person or title word its notes share more than the rest of the notebook; the legend lists the topics with those terms, and a click finds their notes. `GET /graph/structure?topics=1`, `entry/topics.py`, 10,000 notes in 170 ms (GRAPH_PLAN KG6, INBOX 528).
- Links: Find links to add learns from you: linking a suggested pair or dismissing one records which reasons it was offered for, and each kind of reason (similar wording, people both name, a note both link with, a rare tag, the same sitting) is then trusted more or less in this notebook, between half and one and a half times, fading over a month like the app's other lessons (GRAPH_PLAN KG9, part one).
- Links: Find links to add now finds pairs by structure as well as wording: people or things both notes name, a note both link with, a rare tag both carry, and written in the same sitting (support only); each reason shows under the pair with its own confidence and the chip is the combined one; it works with semantic search off; linking a pair found by structure keeps its reasons as the link's reason. `ai/relations.py`, 2k notes in 162 ms and 10k in 802 ms in the sandbox (GRAPH_PLAN KG2, INBOX 528).
- Notes: a note's Connections (the column beside the list and the sheet) show the sentence each linking note says it in, and a new Mentioned, not linked group lists the notes and documents that name it without a link, each with its sentence and a Link button that turns those words into a [[link]] in one click (the server checks the words are still there first). `GET /entries/{id}/backlinks`, `POST /entries/{id}/mentions/link` (GRAPH_PLAN KG1, INBOX 528).
- Glass: one clear (blur-only) recipe, the `--glass-filter-clear` token; seven panels that wrote the blur out take it (nothing changes on screen), and a lint now fails any new backdrop-filter that is neither it nor `--glass-filter` (UI Phase 10, item 102).
- Top bar: the tab strip's layout (centred on the window, centred in the gap, or on its own row) is now decided from the current widths alone; it used to remember its previous mode with 8px of hysteresis, so the same width drew a different layout depending on which way the window had been resized (1500 wrapped where 1440 centred). Measured 1024 to 2560 and back: no width draws two modes and a strip that fits is never wrapped.
- Agent, small model on an OpenAI-compatible server (llama.cpp, LM Studio): an instruction to change the notebook ("Make a note: ...", "Remind me ...", "Pin my ...") asks the server for a tool call on its first round, since a 1.5B model otherwise answered most of them in prose; questions are never forced, and a server that does not know the option is asked again without it (INBOX 527).
- Agent: "Add bring a rain jacket to my Snowdon trip note" (and "put ... in my ... note", "append ...") is offered the note editor; it cued nothing, so a small model rewrote the note in its answer and saved nothing (INBOX 527).
- Agent: a reply that says it did something no tool did ("I've made a new note for you") is now asked, once, to actually do it, naming the tool, and the heads-up that it did not happen is kept for when the retry fails too, checked against everything said in the turn (INBOX 527).
- Agent: when no note matches the words of a question, the prompt no longer says the notebook looks empty; it says nothing matched and that count_notes and search_notes know more (Qwen2.5-1.5B, with four notes saved, answered "How many notes do I have?" with "There are no notes in your notebook") (INBOX 527).
- Agent: tool calls the model asks for in the same reply no longer wait on each other: two web searches in one reply both run (the second was parked behind a confirm, as if the first page had asked for it; a call chosen after reading a page still asks first), and several pages asked for together are fetched side by side, so three pages take about as long as one (INBOX 527).
- Agent: a tool result too big for what is left of the conversation is shortened to fit (long text clipped, then the list kept from the front, with a note saying what was cut) instead of being dropped whole with the tools taken away; on a 4k-window model one page of long notes used to end the turn's reading with nothing read (INBOX 527).
- Agent: a turn that runs out of tool rounds now ends with an answer from what it found (one more round with the tools withdrawn), then the stop and Continue as before, where it used to end on "I stopped after 4 rounds" alone; a skill step still stops plainly so the run marks it stalled. With an OpenAI-compatible server (LM Studio, llama.cpp) the agent retries once when the server answers 5xx, as while a model loads, instead of ending the turn, and a round with no tools no longer sends an empty tool list that strict servers refuse (INBOX 527).
- Agent reminders: set_reminder takes the time in your own words ("two hours before midnight", "tomorrow at 3", "Friday night", "in 20 minutes") and the app works out the date on your clock with no model involved, which is where a model once set "two hours before midnight" for the wrong night; a date-time without an offset is your local time (one was stored as UTC, so 9:00 fired at 19:00 at UTC+10); a time already past is refused with the reason; the prompt no longer teaches the model date arithmetic (INBOX 527; AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM, decided 2026-09-21).
- Agent, with a small model (under 8B): the tools the request names are offered beside the fixed core, so "Pin my dentist note" can pin (on Qwen2.5-1.5B it was offered no pin tool and wrote a duplicate note instead); a long reply that says "I will call the tool to save the note" and calls nothing is asked once to do it; "has been created and pinned" on a turn that only created is caught as a claim the way "I pinned it" is; and the agent prompt now says which notes have pictures, so an answer with tools on can place [picture 2] as Chat and Ask already could (INBOX 527).
- Agent: a tool call a small model writes slightly wrong now runs: JSON with a trailing comma, single quotes, Python's True, a code fence or a cut-off end is read as meant (0 of 5 slips were read before, 5 of 5 now); arguments are checked against the tool's schema before it runs, so a spelling like `id` or `noteId` reaches `note_id`, "12" is read as 12, "false" as false (pin_note read it as true) and one tag as a list; a missing argument is named with its type and an example call (11 of 31 tools named it before, 30 of 31 now, the other being web search switched off); JSON that cannot be read at all is said to be unreadable rather than run as empty (INBOX 527).
- Chat and Ask: the model can place a picture inside its answer: it writes [picture 2] (or [picture 2.2] for the second) for a note that has pictures and the bubble draws it as a figure, at most 320px tall, in the picture's real shape, with its caption on one line, "From note 2: title" opening the note and a click opening the image viewer; an unknown note or number draws nothing and a half-written token never shows while the answer streams; with no token, a cited note whose pictures are the point (the question names a picture, or the note is mostly pictures) gets one figure after its first citation; three at most, and a reopened chat draws the same (INBOX 526; `picture_sizes` saved beside `picture_alts`).
- Toasts: an error toast's Report this keeps its width (it was squeezed to 44px and its words ran out of the box at 390); on a window under 820px the message takes its own line with the buttons under it at the right, both 44px tall under touch.
- Dashboard, Quick access: Add or arrange opens one list of every command with the ones on your dashboard checked and first, so what is added is visible; check or uncheck several, drag rows or press Alt+Up and Alt+Down (or the two small buttons) to order them, search to narrow the list, and Done saves everything at once (Cancel and Escape keep what was there); at eight, a ninth is refused with a warning line in the dialog, not an error toast (INBOX 524).
- Sub-tabs: the Notes (Your notes, Capture, Write with Atlas, Ask), Library and document sidebar strips are one second-level recipe: words on the page with a 2px accent line under the chosen tab, no box or pill, one height (36px, 44 on touch), one 4px gap, one padding, and no icons on any of them; the top bar keeps its pills (INBOX 522).
- Top bar: the tab well hugs its tabs in the layout that centres it between the two groups (at 1150 it was 630px round 503px of tabs, and the same stretched box showed on every boot until the first measure), centred by auto margins (INBOX 522).
- Graph: Arrows (off by default) are sparks: a comet-tailed four-point star 70% along each link in its colour, on a soft glow with a white core, the line wider on its source half; pointing at a note sends a spark drifting along its links unless motion is reduced. 417-note map, three runs: +0.2 ms a frame at the fit, 0.0 at 2x (the glow and core drop out while more than 300 sparks are in view).
- Links: a link a [[name]] made is remembered as one, so deleting the name deletes the link (others are never touched); renaming a note offers, in a toast, to rename the [[links]] other notes write to it. The graph reads each note's text once per edit (18.8 to 3.8 ms at 2,018 notes), sees a link swapped for another, and similarity keeps each note's four closest matches (2,000 notes: 10.7 s to 0.6 s; 10,000: 4.99 s and 144 MB, where every pair was 10.5M tuples).
- Graph (514, parity with Obsidian's graph): Show adds Tags, Attachments and Unwritten links (a faint node per unanswered wiki name; a click writes that note); Display adds Arrows, Text fade and Link thickness; Physics adds Link force and takes Length by similarity and Group by category; focus mode gets a Focus section and the local map an Options fold, each with Depth 1 to 5 and Incoming, Outgoing and Neighbour links.
- Graph: a Display fold in the gear panel holds Labels, Label backgrounds (new: off draws each name on a thin outline instead of a plate, still placed clear of lines), Curved links and Cluster glow; those switches now come back as they were left after a reload.
- Notifications: no empty strip on the right of each row; the read circle and remove cross replace the time while a row is pointed at.
- Settings, Help: hotkeys are drawn as keys, places such as Settings, Models and Library tab, Contents in bold, and control names and quoted phrases as small code chips (190, 139 and 47 across 96 topics), added when the page draws so the Guide's own text stays plain (INBOX 520).
- Settings, Help: a search box at the top keeps only the topics that hold every word you type (title, keywords, text or place), opens them with the words marked, hides empty groups, says "Nothing in Help matches" when none do, and Esc clears it (INBOX 520).
- Companion: perches on every Library sub-tab's dock or cards and hangs from an open board's or map's toolbar, never on an unpainted edge in mid-air; looks again on a sub-tab switch, a resize or content moving under it (INBOX 521, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/perchall.js`).
- Startup: the dashboard waits for its own script, so "renderDashboard is not defined" no longer appears on the lock screen.
- Graph: a line between two notes lights under the pointer and a click on it opens a small card where you clicked: what it is (a link, a thread, a similarity, a map's line), its reason and how sure, the two notes (each opens), and for a link Edit reason and Remove (the owner: "I cant click on links to see their reason in the graph??"; 20 of 20 sampled line middles answer).
- Top bar: the active tab's fill slides to the tab you choose (200ms, transform only) in every engine, by click, keyboard or a jump from elsewhere, and sits on it through a resize; none under reduced motion, and the phone's bottom tabs keep their colour mark.
- Ask: the Matching records cards speak in the Notes list's voice: the text sits at the list's inset, the category is muted, the match reason is one quiet fact after the date instead of a green pill on its own row, links are the list's outlined muted pill on the text edge and one line, and the citation number is the same edged box on a plain card and on the cited one (INBOX 510).
- Graph: names stand on a plate in the card's colour instead of a white outline over the lines, go to the first of eight places that crosses no line (label-line crossings 43 to 28 on a 60-note map), and the automatic category palette is calmer (78% saturation, same lightness); a chosen colour is unchanged (INBOX 493).
- Graph: hovering a note fades the map instead of flipping it: the dimming of every other dot and link, the names that leave and arrive, the hovered note's ring and its similarity scores each ease over 180ms (measured, scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphfade.js: largest single-frame step 1.0 with no frame between, now 0.15 to 0.2 over 7 to 8 frames); reduced motion stays instant.
- Links: [[Name]] links to a note that opens with a "# Name" heading, and a link written before its note exists connects as soon as that note is saved.
- Library: pressing the Library tab inside an open board or mind map goes back to the Library.
- Models status: the poll no longer waits on a busy model runner; with an answer already known it waits at most 2.5s for the runner's model list, then serves the last one while the refresh finishes (a runner answering in 9s held the poll for 5s, now 2.5s), and a timed-out poll, shown as "slow", is no longer logged as a warning.
- Logs: a surface read refused because the app is locked is no longer logged as `[notes] could not load: Locked` at every boot; real failures still are.
- Companion: the enlarged view draws no bar behind a hanging companion's head (a stray grey line at a fixed height); the seat bar under a sitting one stays.
- Atlas: the feminine look's waist band is gone; the body fades into the gown.
- Chat and Ask: an answer grounded in a note with pictures or sketches shows up to three of them beside that note's numbered chip under Grounded in (INBOX 502); the chip opens the note, a picture opens in the image viewer, alt text is the picture's caption or the text read off it (`picture_alts`, sent with the results and saved with the turn). The model is told which notes have pictures, so it can point at one as the picture in note 2.
- Chat and Ask: a question sent from a suggested follow-up shows a Follow-up of line above it, each earlier question in the chain as a link (INBOX 490). In Chat a link scrolls to that question and lights it, and the line is saved with the turn (`followup_of`) so a reopened chat keeps it; in Ask a link opens that earlier answer under the line. A typed question starts a new chain.
- Manage tags and Manage categories do more (INBOX 504): sort by name, notes or most recently used (remembered); Used once (tags) and Empty (categories) narrow to the hardly used; names that look like one (case, spaces, hyphens, a plural) are offered as one Merge with Undo; the count after a name opens its notes; several categories take one colour, or are deleted with one question, each with one Undo. The panels are 40rem wide so the tool row and the footer fit on one line.
- Library, Contents is redesigned as an outline (INBOX 496): one tool row (the filter and a Group by list, remembered between visits, with Expand all and Collapse all in the ⋯), groups that fold with a colour dot or glyph, the name and a quiet count, and one column of rows, each the note's picture or the kind's glyph with the title over one line of facts. The four grouping buttons, the sideways strip of jump chips and the three-column rows are gone; its styles are one block instead of four files.
- Library, Boards and maps loads faster (INBOX 496): a preview's labels are measured on a canvas instead of forcing a page layout per label (65 layouts to 7 on a first visit to 34 boards, style and layout about 300ms to about 100ms), each visit asks for the board list once instead of twice, a second visit draws what it had at once, and the search, sort, kind chips and view switch redraw without asking the server.
- Dashboard: a widget whose data never arrives offers Retry instead of saying "Loading…" for good; the constellation waits for its drawing library.
- Graph: the View menu is gone; layout, colour, size, Trace and the legend are the first section of the gear's panel (Display options), so there is one way in. Pressing Legend no longer closes the panel it is in.
- Library, Documents on a phone: Reload moves into the dock's more menu, so the new ? does not wrap the dock to a second row (114px, as before).
- Library, Boards and maps: one New button in the top bar with Whiteboard and Mind map inside it, in place of the two create buttons (the sentence-case rows keep the same keyboard keys, the tour and the Guide say where they went).
- Reminders: the add card has one worded Add. The sentence box's button is now the wand alone, named Add from this sentence.
- Library: the All, Documents and Bookmarks sub-tabs end their top bar with a ? saying what the sub-tab holds, like Boards and maps, Images and Files already do.
- Settings: "Load the search model when the app starts" chooses a faster first note or a lighter start; four filing and image switches that never saved now do.
- Callouts in the Live view show their kind once: the icon (with a caret, the kind picker) and the title as the line's own text, no ">" or "[!note]" even with the caret on the line, and an empty body says what goes there ("Write the note"). The "/" menu no longer writes a stock question into the body, and the Guide has a Callouts entry.
- The "m" guide is a command panel: Go to and Do as rows with an icon, the name and the key in one column of key chips, the tab you are on marked, the Close in its head and a hint line at its foot. Every key does what it did.
- Chat: the Attach panel is redesigned: one height for every source, a count on each source's tab, rows with an icon or the file's own glyph, the name over one line of facts and a check that fills when the row is on, pictures as a grid, loading and empty states, and keys (arrows, Space, Enter is Done, Escape). The search no longer draws a second box over itself when it is not focused, Clear also takes off pictures, a note's picture is sent as the file it is, and a new document shows the next time the panel opens.
- Notifications: one notification can be removed with the cross beside its read circle; a removed overdue reminder stays removed.
- Tests: a ratchet (`tests/test_no_ui_emoji.py`) fails the build on any emoji, dingbat or pictograph in the UI's scripts, markup or stylesheets, with the documented data cases (Markdown shortcodes, math tables, emoji matchers, the colour-blind status marks) allowed by name; the inventory it came from is `scratchpad/emoji-icons-506.md` (INBOX 506).
- Icons: one icon per action: deleting a backup or a saved look is the trash can (it was a cross), Rename is the plain pencil in the file menu, and the graph's Undo is the counter-clockwise arrow the rest of the app uses (INBOX 506).
- Icons: the scroll-to-top and jump-to-newest buttons, the Models connection note, the live-log pill, the duplicate finder's Merge button, the callout fold chevron and one help line are Phosphor icons now, not typed arrows, dots and symbols (INBOX 506).
- Icons: the marks drawn by CSS (plan-step ticks and crosses, retry, replan and paging marks, the chat title's pencil, the timeline's sort arrows, the active-item check in menus, the two disclosure carets) are Phosphor icons now, not typed characters, so they share the icon font's size, weight and alignment (INBOX 506).
- Notes: a card's text sits further in from its edge and its metadata steps back: the category reads muted at the body weight and link chips are muted until pointed at, so the note's words lead.
- The app emblem no longer throws "appearancePref is not defined" when drawn before Settings has loaded; every Settings helper it uses is checked first.
- The repository no longer sends new issues to GitHub's AI models for a summary (the `summary.yml` workflow is gone); CodeQL, which is static analysis and free on a public repository, stays.
- Timeline rail: each glyph is centred in its circle (INBOX 503, "the timeline icons on the left arent centred in the circles"). The 18.4px circle and 12.88px glyph box left a fractional gap that the two rounded on their own, so each kind of glyph sat off by its own amount. An even circle and glyph box (`round(..., 2px)`, with the old sizes where `round()` is unsupported) leave whole pixels. Measured on the painted ring, glyph ink against the circle's centre (`badgealign.js`): at 1x the note, map and document glyphs were 1.0px off and the bell and clock 0.5, now 0.5 at worst; at 2x the worst was 1.09 across and 1.0 down, now 0.64 and 0.5. At 3x a glyph still paints on a whole CSS pixel while the circle paints on the device's, so up to a pixel of per-row jitter stays.
- Badges: the icon and the words sit on one centre line, and it is the badge's own (INBOX 503, "the text and icons are properly aligned and spaced", "vertically centred as well as aligned with each other"). A flex row centres boxes, and the words' line box is not where the eye reads them, so the old fixed drop on the icon was right for one chip and wrong for the rest. Every chip's words are now a `.ph-text` span trimmed to the x-height band (`text-box: trim-both ex alphabetic`), the icon is centred in its box, one `--space-1` gap (was 3.4, 3.6, 4 and 4.8px), and a `:where(.chip)` height floor keeps every height. Measured by ink at 3x, 1440 and 390, light and dark (`badgealign.js`, `badgesum.js`): the status labels ("Installed", "Fits", "In use for chat") had the icon 1.17px low against the words and the words 1.1px above the label's middle, now 0.28 and 0.44; the map chip's icon 1.5px low, now 0.17; the reminder chip 0.83, now 0.17; the repeat chip on a phone was 2.4px low in its own fill, now 0. Note-meta chips ("Tag with Atlas", "No tags yet") keep the icon within 0.17px of their words; their words sit about 0.2px further from the middle than before, because Chromium paints text on a whole CSS pixel. Where `text-box` is unsupported the old drop stands.
- The app emblem no longer throws "ACCENTS is not defined" when it is drawn before Settings has loaded (the assistant avatar on the lock screen); it reads the page's accent colour instead.
- Help: the Guide's troubleshooting topic and its manual steps send "looks out of date or broken after an update" to Settings, Import & export, Clear app cache (new keywords: out of date, clear cache, stale, after an update), and the Import and export topic names the App cache group (INBOX 487).
- Settings, Data, Clear app cache (INBOX 487, "should there be a way to clear the cache??"): unregisters the service worker, empties Cache Storage, drops the server's compressed copies and reloads, with a toast first; nothing in the notebook is touched. The Reload the app button and Ctrl+Alt+R clear the same things. Found by it: the emblem loaded p5 at the first idle moment, so on a slow load `renderEmblem` threw on `ACCENTS` before settings.js had run; it now waits for the load event.
- Server: `POST /system/clear-static-cache` (behind the unlock) deletes the compressed static-file copies in `<data dir>/cache/static-gz` and empties the in-memory copy; nothing in the notebook is touched. The server half of Settings, Data, Clear app cache (INBOX 487).
- Dialogs: a head keeps its height when the card fills, so Find anything's hairline no longer crosses its title and buttons, and its search field has room under the head.
- The Guide: Atlas's reply bubble is full width from the first frame instead of a narrow box that widened as the answer came in.
- Chat and Ask read the text in a note's pictures when the note is mostly a picture, not only when it is attached by hand: a screenshot of typed ideas reached the model as a link, and each picture's reading may now run to 1,200 characters (was 240).
- The Thinking fold is one panel when open, its summary the head, and the reasoning is set as Markdown (bold, lists) with the prompt's data markers taken out, in Chat, Ask, the palette and the Guide.
- Chat: a reply's copy, regenerate and fork row can no longer show over the open Attach panel.
- Help: the addresses topic says how to link to one thing (Copy app link in a note, document, board, mind map or chat menu, pasted into a note to open in the same window) and tells it from Copy wiki link; DESIGN.md's recipe index gets the Copy app link row (INBOX 483).
- An address of this app pasted into a note or a document (a link or a bare address) renders as a link that opens the view in the same window, labelled with the view's title or "Note 12"; it must be this origin and page and a route the router opens, so other links keep their new-tab behaviour and the safe-scheme rules are unchanged. Ctrl+click on one in the document editor opens it in the same window too, and its right-click menu offers Copy link address (INBOX 483).
- Copy app link (INBOX 483, "can there be easy ways to copy the address of various notes or objects"): a note's card menu (under Connect), a document (the Documents list, the Library rows and the editor's menu), a board or mind map (the gallery's menu and the open board's Board menu) and a chat (the list row and the header menu) each copy the address that opens it in the app; the existing "Copy [[link]]" rows are now "Copy wiki link", and the board gallery and chat row menus are grouped past five rows.
- The router has one table of addressable objects (`ROUTE_OBJECTS`) behind `routeHash` and the new `routeHashFor(kind, id)`, and `copyObjectAddress(kind, id)` copies an object's full address (origin, path and hash) through the shared clipboard helper and toasts "Link copied" (INBOX 483, the helper the Copy app link rows use).
- Notes: the x on a suggested tag, a link or any chip that ends in one is drawn as a cross centred on its target, quiet at rest, red with its disc on hover; it was a font glyph nudged by hand inside a grey disc.
- The Library sub-tab bar hides while a whiteboard or mind map is open, at every width, as it never showed on the documents editor; the board's own Boards button brings the list and the bar back (INBOX 476)
- The popup agent's head has room above its input: the head keeps the Find anything head's bottom padding and no longer shrinks under the starters, so the avatar stands 21px above the field instead of 5px (INBOX 475)
- A note's connections row has a Show less after +N more links (it opened and could not close again), and a connection chip reads plain words: a link shows its text, no brackets, no URL, no ** or _ (INBOX 474)
- Notes list: a long note's clamped preview shows 4 lines by default (3 compact, 5 spacious), up from 2 on desktop and 1 on a phone, through one `--note-preview-lines` token; blank lines still collapse while clamped (INBOX 473)
- Companion: it comes on screen a way that suits where it lands and not the same way twice (INBOX 501, the owner: "it just kinda appears ... or even differences on how it gets there"). Each place has its ways (hanging: down from the bar or gathering out of starlight; the bottom bar: up over it or gathering; near a side: walking on, gliding in or gathering) and the last one is left out; the climb fades up over its first half (136 to 200ms before, 210 to 290ms now). Measured on the dashboard: the climb down five times in five before, two ways alternating now (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/companionarrive.js`). Reduced motion still fades in where it is.
- Companion: an act or a walk cut short eases back instead of snapping, and Atlas's expressions settle over 0.6s instead of 0.2s (INBOX 497, the owner: "less sudden beginning and stopping of actions"). Before, taking an act off mid-way put every part back at rest in one frame (7 to 22px, against 2 to 4px a frame while the act ran); now the parts are read where they are and eased back over 480ms, unless motion is reduced. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/companionblend.js` measures it.
- Atlas, feminine look: no thin strings rising from the lower body, and a soft sash at the waist (INBOX 480, the owner: "two wierd thin string like appendages coming from the feminine atlas lower body up top"). The strings were the ribbon tails' lit edges and pale streams; the tails are fills alone, and the waist the gown hangs from is a filled lilac band with a sheen and no outline, in every pose.
- Companion: Atlas's pupils stay inside its eyes wherever the pointer is (INBOX 497, the owner: "the pupils basically go off the head and you can only see white eyes"). Four offsets added up on its iris (the generated faces' eye moves, its own look, the mood's pupil placement and the lean), measured at up to 3.3 times the pupil's room; now the aim is held inside a circle rather than a square, the generated faces' moves are not Atlas's, its look is scaled to the room, and the mood's own placement eases aside while it looks. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/companioneyes.js` tests every point of each pupil against its white at four poses, both looks and six moods, the gaze at the 8 compass points and the window's corners: 0 outside (was 286 of 320 at calm).
- Atlas, feminine look: her hair meets the brow as a side-swept fringe, not a night cap (INBOX 480, the owner: "it still looks like she's wearing a night cap"). The smooth dome's arc of a hairline and its parallel strand lines are gone; the hair parts off centre and sweeps across the brow in three soft locks of different lengths with the forehead showing between them, a fine shade up each notch, and a small star pinned at the parting. Masculine pixel-identical.
- Atlas, feminine look: the gown flows into five broad ribbon tails instead of three thin folds that read as a tripod (INBOX 480, the owner: "less like a tripod and more like whispy ribbony/flowy tails", then "too thin and stick like ... seem like they sprout from th emiddle bottom"). Rooted across the dress's lower half and fading in over it, 7.4 to 9 across at the root, each sweeping out past the hem with a twist and a lifted wisp; a back tier in the nebula's lilac and a sheer front tier, each its own layer drifting on its own clock (6.3s and 8.1s, on their boxes, the compositor's) out of step with the gown. Poses, walks and gestures take them as the gown; companion cost within noise.
- Atlas, feminine look: her lower body is a gown with a train, not a pale skirt of straight strands (INBOX 480). Close at the waist with a soft hip and a trumpet flare, its colour deepening from her skin's light to the nebula's violet at a hem of two slow waves, a sheer overskirt as a second tier, a train behind in the nebula's colours sweeping toward the comet tail, a lit hem, stars, and three fine folds of light that open with the flare. Every pose keeps its shape (sit pools, hang falls, float trails), the sway is the layer root's as before, the lower layer holds 13 elements where it held 25, and the masculine look is pixel-identical (companionshots.js).
- Atlas, feminine look: the brow is one small star set in the swept hair at its peak, in a faint halo; the lit hairline, the dust at its roots and the circlet of dots on a thread, four arcs of light from wing to wing that read as a stray headband, are gone, and the hair meets the brow in a soft shade (INBOX 480). The masculine look is unchanged; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/atlasgown.js` draws the brow close up and every pose.
- Companion, large view: its speech line sits in its bubble again (INBOX 481); the bubble was a 15px box behind the first letter with a 132px line running out over the art, because the stage's `right` and the figure's `left: 100%` both applied. A bubble now takes its width from its words, wraps inside the window past 16rem, and `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/companionsay.js` measures every pose, both looks and the large view at 1440 and 390.
- Chat: the '?' (About this chat) is in the dock with every other tab's help, before the ⋯, and stays there once a conversation has messages; it was in the empty welcome's corner and went with it (INBOX 479).
- Library, Files: the search field is announced as "Search the files" (it kept the Images gallery's name on the sub-tab that shares it) (INBOX 479).
- Boards and maps: the board picker in the top bar shows the board's name below 1216px wide, growing into the bar's free width up to 14rem and giving way first when the bar is full (it was capped at 8rem, "Board · ..." at 820 beside 89px of empty bar); nothing overflows at 1152, 1024, 820, 780 or 390 (INBOX 479).
- Top bar, 600 to 1199: when the tabs take a row of their own, their well is drawn round the tabs and centred (446px at 820) instead of across the whole window (788px round 430px of tabs); the header's height is unchanged (INBOX 479).
- Mind maps: the top bar's Map chip is a fact (the dock's quiet chip, as the Graph's count) rather than the filter chip's pressed state, which read as a toggle that did nothing; the tool rail is one height again, the layout picker and the Map section's '?' at the tools' 36px (were 28 and 32) (INBOX 479).
- Settings: the head is the dialog head every popup wears; profile, guide, Back and Forward are 32px like Close (were 28px beside it) and the title takes the dialog title's voice (INBOX 479).
- Top bar: the space picker wears every dock select's face (the field's inset ground, the 3:1 edge, a 400 label) instead of the tinted, bold quiet-button face that made it louder than the selected tab; Lock and Quit sit past a drawn seam, the status bar's own hairline with 8px either side, where they were 16px from Settings with nothing between. Every item stays 44px on one centre line.
- Status bar: each glyph meets its word (INBOX 494). Measured by ink at 3x, glyph centre against the label's x-height centre: Ask was 1.83px high, Guide 1.67, the notebook count 1.17, the Ctrl K chip 0.83, reminders 0.67, Find 0.50; now every one within 0.5px, light and dark (`inkalign.js`).
- Dashboard: arranging the page is its own control (INBOX 488). The dock is the search, Customise and the ⋯: Customise holds View, Widgets, Edit layout, Edit quick access and Reset quick access; the ⋯ keeps Continue, skills, Tools & features and Commands; the Quick access row's own ⋯ is gone, so no menu opens over another menu's button. On a phone Customise is its glyph beside the ⋯. The Guide's dashboard topic says the same.
- Docks: a zone that wraps onto a line of its own no longer opens that line with the hairline that parts it from the zone before (7 docks at 640, 3 at 768 and 820; now 0), and a line that starts at the dock's edge lines up with the title above it; read from the layout by `markDockLineStarts` (phone-shell.js) without changing any zone's outer width, so no wrap moves (INBOX 479).
- Developer sweeps: the dock and bar audit for INBOX 478 and 479 (`scratchpad/dock-audit-479.md`): every top and bottom bar control by control at 1440, 1024, 820 and 390, light and dark (`barinv479.js`), wrapped-line hairlines (`dockseams.js`) and the graph's corner (`graphcorner.js`); 14 findings ranked, a target layout per bar, and the de-vibe pass (`devibe.js` and `vibecheck.js` both 0).
- Settings and Help: an open section's arrow points down again; since this morning's one-marker change every one of 109 folds kept it pointing right.
- The messages the server computes for a toast now read as plain sentences (INBOX 472, the 45 computed `detail` routes): install hints name what to install in Settings, Packages instead of a `pip` line, an AI failure in Improve, Title, chat summary and Models is one sentence with the provider's text in the log, a damaged backup restore answers 422 with a sentence instead of a bare 500, and `tests/test_core_message_wording.py` checks the sources of those messages (and that no route shows a raw exception)
- Web search and SearXNG setup messages read as plain sentences: the transport's error, the command's own output, `virtualenv`, `setup.py`, `docker logs` and an environment variable name no longer reach the toast; each goes to the log, and the message points at Settings, Logs (INBOX 472, computed messages)
- Library: Boards and maps selection ticks sync under the Maps and Boards chips (no card got a tick while one was on, so Select all and bulk Delete were dead); the tick sync and the gallery narrow through one function.
- Settings: the Find duplicates slider keeps a real width at 390 (was 6.8x16px in a wrapped row; now a 221x44 line of its own) and takes the touch floor, 28px with a mouse. The touch sweep now measures Dashboard, Timeline, Reminders and seven Settings sections (they read 0 controls and passed), and measures a slider by its own box.
- Notes: the empty state's Ask Atlas offer is one line at 390 ("Ask Atlas where notes go", 192x44; the two-line label was 332x46); the question it sends is unchanged.
- Chat: the suggestion chips (and Ask's suggested and recent questions) take the touch floor: 44px tall under a coarse pointer or below 820, 28px with a mouse as before (were 28px at 390).
- Chat, no model: the Try asking chips ask in Notes, Ask, which answers from the notes without a model; with the box closed they still sent to Chat, and "Summarise my notes" over two saved notes answered "I couldn't find any saved notes" (INBOX 472, first run)
- Welcome, setup card: one mark (the stethoscope under the app's emblem is gone), four lines instead of six at 1440 (the first card's privacy sentence and "0.0 MB so far" are not repeated), no comma splice, and with no model running a Connect a model offer that opens Settings at Models (INBOX 472, first run)
- Empty states say it once, as a title and one sentence: the empty dashboard's card is "How MemoryMap works" under a hero that says "No notes yet" (both said "Your notebook is empty," as comma splices), its footer is one line, the Library's All view titles "Nothing here yet" with its sentence under it (it was two bold sentences), and Bookmarks says what a bookmark is (INBOX 472, first run)
- Dashboard, empty notebook: the start tiles draw the Quick access tile's two lines (label 600, description 400 at the small size); they were 900 and 600 a row below 600 and 400 (INBOX 472, first run)
- The AI status dot with no model connected is a calm grey ring (the one Settings, Models draws beside "isn't running"), not an amber "!": on a phone it was a 44px amber circle in the top bar, the loudest thing on a new person's first screen; its popup now says Settings, Models connects one (INBOX 472, first run)
- Graph: a notebook with no notes says "Nothing to map yet" with Capture a note; it said "Every note is hidden. All 0 notes are filtered out" with a button that could show nothing (INBOX 472, first run)
- README: Meet Atlas is a title, a one-line headline, two sentences and Atlas delighted; What it does names this week's work (shape text and connector labels, map tasks, notes behind a topic and numbered branches, documents that reopen where you left them, faster starts, plain error messages) and Manage categories; the frontend's script count is 64 (INBOX 431 (g)).
- README screenshots retaken in the dark theme from the showcase notebook: 22 pictures (the dashboard, Notes, Ask, Chat, the graph with dense clusters, a sparse web and loose notes, the Library and Activity, Timeline, Reminders, Documents and focus mode, a board with shape text and labelled connectors, a mind map with tasks, notes and numbered branches, the palette, Tools and features, Settings, Your look, the popup agent, the corner companion, a light and dark split, a phone, and Atlas delighted), each under 400 KB; `readmeshots.js` takes them all, `pngshrink.py` keeps the graph's colours when it reduces the palette (INBOX 431 (g)).
- Chat: a turn answered fast no longer saves as two conversations; the save at the end waits for the agent round's checkpoint when one is still creating the conversation (the same question was listed twice, 43ms apart, one of them half a turn) (INBOX 431 (g)).
- Library, Activity: a change to a board, a board item, a drawing, a bookmark, a model, your private notes, a recording, the search index or your notebook's data now reads in words ("Edited a board item"), where it read "Edited whiteboard_object" or "Edited board"; a test fails on any logged kind with no phrase (INBOX 431 (g)).
- Developer sweeps: `seed-showcase.py` builds the README's notebook on a fresh data dir through the API: 75 notes in seven categories over seven weeks, 87 links (39 with a reason) in two dense clusters, a looser one, a sparse web and loose notes, reminders, three documents, a board with shape text and labelled connectors, a mind map with tasks, notes and numbered branches, and saved chats (INBOX 431 (g)).
- Mind maps: a task count on a coloured or filled topic takes the label's ink; the muted grey there measured 4.39:1 on the blue tint.
- Settings, Logs: the server's line for every request is hidden unless "Show request lines" is on in the log's menu; on a fresh start they were 505 of 510 rows.
- The dashboard greeting ends in a full stop or a question mark, never an exclamation mark, like the rest of the app's copy; an older cached greeting corrects itself on the next render.
- A test now holds the wording of every server error message (tests/test_server_detail_wording.py): each one has to read as a sentence with a full stop, with no field name, path, dash or exclamation mark, because the toast shows it as written; the voice and update messages were tidied to pass (INBOX 472)
- Error sentences, whiteboards and mind maps: the messages that named fields ("needs a ref_id", "/media/... url", "No node with id 12") and the XML import message that printed a <!DOCTYPE> tag now say what to do in plain words (INBOX 472)
- Error sentences, models, settings, spaces and the timeline: a model that is not running now says to start it, a space name or icon that is not accepted says what to do instead of naming the field, and the timeline's bad-value messages read "Pick one of: ..." (INBOX 472)
- Error sentences, files, reminders and the learned page: "File is missing from disk", "No upload with that id", "no such derived fact", "as_of must be YYYY-MM-DD" and the image-reading hints now read as sentences a person can act on ("No installed model can read images. Install or pick one in Settings"), and no longer name a field (INBOX 472)
- Error sentences, notes, documents and chat: a missing note, document, bookmark, link, revision or conversation, a date written wrongly, a private note that needs unlocking, and a skill missing an input now each say what happened in a plain sentence with a full stop, and name no field ("boards must be one of", "action must be keep or fallback" became "Pick one of...") (INBOX 472)
- Error sentences, sign-in and backups: what the server says when a request is refused (the app is locked, a wrong password, a throttled unlock, a missing backup, a bad bookmark address, a category that cannot move) is now a plain sentence with a full stop, and an unexpected failure says to try again and where the log is, instead of "Internal error" (INBOX 472)
- The unlock check no longer queries the database on every request: once a password is known to exist it is remembered for ten seconds (only the yes, so the gate can only ever be stricter), 0.4 ms off each of the forty-odd requests a start makes.
- Settings > About names the licence (GNU AGPL v3) under the version, and a version that cannot be read says so instead of "Version ?" (INBOX 472)
- Copy: the start-up failure notice lost two escaped em-dashes, two toasts lost their exclamation marks, and the SearXNG settings line no longer says "JSON API" (INBOX 472)
- Error messages read as sentences: a failed request no longer toasts a raw JSON list, "Internal error", "Not Found", "Failed to fetch" or "Upload failed (500)"; the plain wording comes from one function, and the raw text still goes to Settings > Logs (INBOX 472)
- Faster starts and every request: each stylesheet and script is compressed once per version and kept on disk (the 448 KB stylesheet went from 22 to 46 ms per fetch to 4 to 6 ms, the first fetch after a restart included), and the two remaining `BaseHTTPMiddleware` layers are pure ASGI, 0.3 to 0.8 ms less on every request.
- An Atlas look with legs no longer restyles the page through a leap or a glide: the two leg roots (`<svg>`, where Chromium never composites `rotate` and `scale`) sit in boxes like the body, tail, skirt and nebula, and the limb gestures turn the boxes. No shipped look draws legs yet; with them switched on, a leap's 2s window fell from 102ms and 59 style recalcs to 60ms and 36, frame for frame the same pixels.
- The Atlas companion's pose, lean, variant and walk properties no longer restyle all 528 of its elements at a time: `--atl-lean-dir`, `--atl-v1`/`--atl-v2`, the pose's lean, scale and tail, the walk's tilt and way, and the figure's lie shift are registered not to inherit and written on the few elements that read them, so one change of `data-pose`, `data-lean` or `data-atlas-variant` costs 9, 4 and 4ms of style recalc (25, 16 and 15 before) and a walk's start restyles 52 elements, not 528. The large view's ledge no longer uses a `:has()` on the companion's `data-pose` (it made every pose change restyle 968 elements); the figure carries a copy of the pose instead. Every shot (looks, moods, lie and curl in all three variants, lean, four mid-float frames) matches the old pixels, and every computed arm, figure and lean value matches.
- The Atlas companion's skirt gestures in a float or glide (the `rotate` limb loops on its `<svg>` root, never on the compositor) run on the same kind of box, so a float costs about half the style recalcs and a third fewer layouts (122ms to 69ms of recalc in the 2.6s window, 62 to 39 recalcs, 35 to 24 layouts).
- The Atlas companion no longer restyles the page every frame at rest: the body's sway, the tail's and the nebula's flow ran as `rotate` and `translate` loops on `<svg>` roots, which Chromium never puts on the compositor, so each cost a style recalc per frame (108ms of every 2.6s idle, now 7ms). They run on a plain box around each root, and the figure looks the same, frame for frame.
- Documents: a document reopens where you left it, the caret and the place you were reading, including after a reload (kept per document in this browser, the 60 most recent).
- Documents: the breadcrumb above the writing follows what you are reading: scrolled away from the caret in a long document it names the section in view (the same one the outline marks), instead of staying on the caret's section.
- Documents: in a long document, jumping to the middle (the scrollbar, a search hit) no longer leaves headings drawn as raw `###` text in the Live view; the view repaints when the parser catches up, which it used to do only on the next key or scroll.
- Developer sweeps: switchdivider.js measures each Settings switch row's hairline against its group head; the INBOX 464 audit records items 9 to 20 as fixed, with their numbers.
- Dashboard on a phone: the search field runs to its menu button with the bar's usual gap (it stopped 19px short).
- Library, Bookmarks: the empty state no longer repeats the line under the bar; it is its title and Add a bookmark.
- Settings, Data: importing markdown files, a folder or a document is one step: the button opens the picker and choosing starts the import, with Undo in the toast that moves exactly the imported notes to the recycle bin (it was choose, then a second Import button).
- Reminders: Quick set takes the steppers' rounded shape, so the When row draws one corner instead of two.
- Chat: the Ask Atlas offer in an empty chat is one line on a phone ("Ask Atlas what it can change"), and on a phone every Ask Atlas offer takes a button's corner rather than a pill, so a longer question no longer wraps into a capsule.
- Library: Everything and Boards & maps count boards the same way; the empty default board no longer counts (or shows) as a board in one and not the other, and a notebook with no boards shows the New board empty state.
- Folds in Settings, the help guide and task logs show the same caret as the Library's Contents and outlines, where they drew a small triangle of their own.
- Settings: the line between two switch rows stops where its group head's underline does (it ran 9px past it on each side), and on a phone the Tools list no longer runs 4px past its pane.
- Dashboard: a widget with nothing to show offers the one thing to do about it (Add a reminder, New board, Add a bookmark, Ask a question, Show untagged notes and so on), opening the tab it lives on first; eleven widgets were a sentence only.
- Top tab bar: choosing a tab no longer nudges the tabs after it sideways; the selected label is drawn heavier without getting wider (it moved the rest by up to 6px).
- Timeline: a row's title runs to the row's edge; long first lines were cut at 120 characters with most of the row still empty.
- Settings: the Tools, Personas and Help panes open on one line of description (Tools had three); "turn one off and Atlas is never offered it" now sits over the tool switches it is about.
- Library Images and Files: the empty state's button is Upload, the verb its bar already uses (it was Capture a note); Settings → Models no longer says "Ollama isn't running" twice in two lines.
- File pickers (Import markdown, Import a document and the rest) look like the Import button beside them: the same face, edge and weight, where they wore that button's hover colour and a near-invisible edge.
- Library previews keep a document's or note's blocks apart: a heading, a list item or a table row is followed by a dot ("Goals · Ship the notebook redesign · Cut travel spend by 15%"), where they used to run on as one sentence.
- Command palette on a phone: the keyboard hints and key chips are gone where there is no keyboard, and the field's prompt ("Search notes or run a command…") fits its box.
- Settings on a phone: the head is one row again with Close in its corner, on every section and down to 320px (it wrapped onto a second line); the profile face and Back and Forward give way to the section picker, and below 380px Peek is its eye alone. Reminders' empty state no longer says "add one above" where nothing is above.
- Settings: switches line up with the heads, labels and hints of their group; every switch row sat 9px inside that edge.
- Settings: every section head after a pane's title now heads a group like the rest (Personas' Answer style, Dashboard greeting, Add your own and Share; Templates' and Skills' last; Web search's three), instead of sitting loose on the pane in a smaller voice.
- Appearance, Assistant avatar now reaches Ask's answer, the writing room's draft and the guide's chat rows: each opens with the same reply head as Chat (the Atlas or app emblem face, then the name), repainted live when the setting changes.
- Notes filed in the background settle in tens of milliseconds, not 1 to 4 seconds: the embedding of a note-sized text now runs on one torch thread (`MEMORYMAP_EMBED_THREADS` to change it), which was 2.2 s against 79 ms whenever the machine was busy.
- Toasts raised while a dialog is open (Quick note, any dialog's Undo) now show inside it and can be pressed; they were drawn behind the dialog.
- Settings, Appearance, Atlas and faces (INBOX 463 (2)): Assistant avatar picks the face on the assistant's chat replies, the popup agent and the Atlas guide: Atlas (the default) or the app's animated emblem, still under Reduce motion. Open replies change as you choose; other personas keep their own faces.
- Colour contrast (INBOX 464): a new sweep, `contrastui.js`, measures what `contrast.js` could not (icons, SVG icons, focus rings, field and select edges, selected states, chip edges; WCAG 1.4.11, 3:1). On the default look it found 79 failures at 1440 in light and 74 in dark; all are fixed through one token, `--control-edge`: text fields, select openers, date inputs and suggestion chips draw it, a selected segment and a chosen radio option are outlined as well as tinted, a field's hover edge is no weaker than its resting edge, the caret icons are no longer dimmed by opacity, a focused composer's edge is the accent text colour, and the palette's lit row shows its keycap and description in ink. High contrast makes the edge ink.
- Motion (INBOX 459 (2)): switching tabs fades the new page in briefly instead of swapping it between two frames; instant with reduced motion on.
- Motion (INBOX 459 (2)): folding a sidebar to its rail, or unfolding it, moves its contents toward or from the rail in a short fade instead of in one frame, and focus mode's Sidebar and Suggestions panels slide in from their edge.
- Motion (INBOX 459 (2)): the chosen option's highlight now slides to the next one in every segmented control, the top bar's tabs, the Notes and Library sub-tabs and the Settings section list, instead of vanishing and reappearing; it is instant with reduced motion on.
- Clear: Capture (with its title, tags and staged files), Quick note, Ask, Chat and the popup agent each get a quiet eraser button that shows only while the box holds something, and Undo puts the words back.
- Manage categories: a category's note count is quiet text after its name ("Hobbies · 10") instead of a pill on every row.
- Companion: the resize ring no longer shows on the companion in its enlarged view.
- Documents: focus mode has a Sidebar button on its bar that opens the document list and outline as a panel on the left (Esc closes it); a reload in the session now also restores Tools and the idle fade, which an initialisation-order error had been dropping.
- Companion (INBOX 455 (2), 469): it goes from place to place by the shape of the move: a walk along its ledge, a hop, shuffle or scoot for a small step, a leap with a crouch and an arc between ledges, a climb along and then up or down an edge hand over hand, a glide for long ways and a soft materialise past that; Atlas floats and glides. A new place chosen mid-move takes over at the speed it had (the hand-over frame went from 35px to under 15). Coming into a tab it walks or glides in from the side of the tab it left. Its arms swing as it walks, reach as it climbs, go out for balance on a leap and like wings on a glide, Atlas's hem trails, and a new act starts with a small lift of the arms. Reduce motion is still a short crossfade.
- Companion (INBOX 462): a folded sidebar is no longer a perch. On Chat and Documents it used to sit on in the air over a row of the folded rail; folding the sidebar now sends it to the nearest perch it can be seen on, by the way it moves.
- Reminders: switching Open, All and Done no longer flashes loading placeholders; they show on the first load only.
- Settings: after clicking a section, the arrow keys walk the list of sections, and Page Up and Page Down scroll the open section.
- Badges (INBOX 461 (1), 468): every status word is the one label recipe, an 11px word in a hairline box with its tone on the edge and icon: Packages' "Installed" and "Not ready yet", SearXNG's "Stopped" or "Running", Tesseract's state, a tool's "confirms first" and "online", the installed model's "in use", and a model card's "Fits", "Tight fit", "Installed" and "In use for chat" (they were four fills at 21 to 23px beside 19px labels). A suggested model card's labels are a row of their own above its actions, one line at 1440, 1100 and 390 (the foot had wrapped into up to three).
- Notes (INBOX 455 (1)): a note's details line is one line on every card. Tags and suggestions that do not fit fold into one "+N" that lists them (a tag filters, a suggestion is taken), then the other facts keep only their icon; the time is always the line's last fact at its right edge (at 1100, 6 of 10 seeded cards wrapped and the time sat on a line of its own on some; now none, one date x per width at 1440, 1100, 820 and 390). The low-score warning sits beside the category.
- Top bar: the logo, the space picker, the tab strip and the icon buttons share one 44px height on one centre line; between 1100 and 1439px the wordmark gives way so the tabs stay on one row.
- Whiteboard: the Library panel's note rows light up under the pointer and show two lines cut at a word; an active button's icon (Library, and every pressed quiet button) takes its label's colour instead of fading into the accent.
- Settings: a section's jump strip marks the heading you chose, even near the end of a short page where it used to mark the last one.
- Dashboard: the Start something row is now Quick access: the same five tiles until you change it, then add any command from the palette (up to eight, with the line it already says), remove, drag to reorder or use Move left and Move right in a tile's menu, and Reset to default, all from the section's own menu; kept per user in preferences (INBOX 461).
- Notes: a long note's folded preview shows two lines of its text again; blank lines after the title or between paragraphs had left it a lone "...".
- Assistant bubbles (INBOX 457, 458): the popup agent's Thinking box sits under Atlas's name, not above it, and every thinking box (Chat, the popup agent, Ask, the Guide, Write with Atlas) is one fold: the same summary as the steps and sources folds, a rail, body text, a 12rem cap. The popup agent's bubble reads like Chat's (name, thinking, steps, answer, sources, facts, actions, with even 6px gaps); its copy and retry row no longer covers the sources; its sources are one list without duplicates, a row per note (title, category dot, date); its run facts are Chat's one muted line, a long model id cut short with the whole id on hover. Scrolling up while an answer streams now holds in the popup agent, Chat and the Guide until you come back to the bottom.
- Notifications: every row is inset 8px on both sides, so the unread dot and the read toggle no longer sit on the panel's edges.
- Attach picker (Chat's note button, INBOX 467): rows are the name over one muted line with the category as a dot and quiet text (it was a filled badge on the name's line), the footer is the dialog footer (count at the left, a ghost Clear and the one filled Done; the buttons were small), and it is padded and cornered like every other panel.
- Popup windows and panels are one design (INBOX 456, measured on 42 surfaces at 1440 and 390, light and dark): every small dialog (new space, templates, document history, word goal, widgets, tensions, storage) opens with the dialog head and a Close; the skill runner's worded Cancel, the Extract, Writing dictionary, popup agent, Find anything, node popup, new-note popup, board overview, agent activity and tour closes are the same 32px icon button at the same corner (44 by touch), and every sheet's too; a head's title is 16px whatever tag carries it (the Quick note, popup agent and node popup titles were 12px uppercase, 700 or 14.7px); the notifications panel is 8px like every other panel (was 6.4px) and the five floating panels are padded one step (were 8 to 16px); small dialogs are one 34rem width (the storage dialog was 1332px) and sit as far from a phone's edge as the others (12px, now 24px); the dim behind every dialog is one token (it was four values), and Find anything dims the app like the popup agent instead of replacing it with the page gradient.
- View toggles (Library, Notes, Timeline, Reminders): the selected segment sits inside its well with 4px all round; it was 4px down, flush on the well's bottom edge, and by touch it spilled 16px out.
- Library, AI skills (INBOX 450): a card's facts are one row of equal-height boxes on one baseline (24px each; the plain chip and the two disclosures were 20 and 22px, 2px apart), "3 steps" and "4 tools" are toggles whose lists open under the row at the card's full width, so opening one no longer pushes the next fact onto a line of its own, and a tool is a code chip at the same height; what a skill asks for before it runs moves to its run line ("Never run · asks for 1 input"), so the facts fit a card on one line. The cards are dealt into columns in reading order, so a short card no longer stands over a gap to its taller neighbour's row and an open card no longer makes its neighbours tall and empty, and "Never run" sits 8px over the footer's line (was 16). The top bar is one row whenever the page has 58rem (at 1440 with a Windows scrollbar it was two, 90px, with New skill and '?' alone on the second; now 50px) and below that wraps on purpose: title, search, New skill and '?' first, the segment and the sort under them; its title says "AI skills", as the sub-tab does.
- Top bar: the tabs are back to their first size (36px, 16px labels, a 4px well); the density pass had made them 32px with 13.6px labels.
- Consistency pass, second round (INBOX 437 (4)): Settings' search field and section rows are on the panel's 32px control height (were 42 and 35, the nav column 84px shorter), a slider's reset, the zoom steppers and a backup's delete stand as tall as the field beside them (were 28 and 36), every page has at most one filled button (Import & export had five, Models five once a model is connected, Appearance four, Personas and What it learned two; a lint now holds it), and the theme cards are one height per grid (a lone Lagoon was 79px under rows of 96). On a phone a reminder is two lines, 82px (was 119): the tick spans both, the words and the time on the first, the snoozes, Edit and the menu (44px targets kept) on the second, starting under the words rather than under the tick. Library: Bookmarks no longer repeats the All chip's count on a line of its own (it says "Showing 2 of 4" only when narrowed), a link's facts stay on one line as they were meant to (a later rule's wrap had won; on a phone a row was 75px with the dot alone at a line's end, now 59), and on a phone its tick is the light 22px box of every other list rather than a 44px frame; Contents shows its jump bar from four groups, as Settings' own index does, instead of repeating two heads; an AI skill card spaces its parts by its one gap (207px, was 262) and its menu is Run's height; an image tile loses a 10px blank band under its name (146px, was 156); a Files row names the kind once on its facts line, not also under the glyph that spells it; the Boards grid ends on its card's padding (a 48px band, now 16). Notes: every name in the sidebar starts on one edge (All and the categories began 23px left of Drafts, Favourites and Tags; All has a glyph now and a category its colour dot, as on a note's chip), and the help '?' in the Capture, Write with Atlas and Ask heads is 32px like the head's other buttons (was 36). Documents: Read view no longer shows a document's name twice when its text already opens on it as a heading, and the hint under the editor no longer repeats the dock's "Saved". On a phone the AI skill library's All, Yours and Built-in segment no longer wraps out of its well over the search field: it takes its own row, and the sort shares the next with New skill.
- Docs: the README, ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, the roadmap and handover tables and CLAUDE.md's counts are checked against the code and current (INBOX 448 (2)): the README lists Quick note, the offline outbox, `#tags`, kept suggestions, the tag manager, category colours, job last-run status, the Library's bookmarks, Contents and AI skills pages, mind map keys, the OCR engine line and the accessibility work; ARCHITECTURE has `core/jobruns.py` and the `job_runs` table, `GET /jobs/last-runs`, the suggested tags, `client_key` on `POST /entries`, the lazy pieces, the migration head and a directory map that matches the tree; DESIGN has the pending note row, the toast yielding to focus and the row's centred actions; the plan tables say what is built (61 scripts, 5,700+ tests, `app.js` and 24 files after it).
- Notes: a note held offline shows its title as the saved card will, rather than the raw `# Title` line.
- Zoom (WCAG 2.2, INBOX 433): on a window under 420px tall (200% and 400% zoom) Chat flows as a page instead of squeezing its welcome under the composer, the Timeline's feed keeps a usable height (it had 0px at 400%), and the graph keeps a 26rem map with the minimap put away so the zoom strip, dock and legend no longer overlap; the AI status popup takes no clicks while it fades; Reminders' row actions sit on their own line below 600px instead of over the tick box; Chat's mode switch is no longer cut off in the touch band; the chat's hidden file field is no longer a Tab stop. zoom.js on Chat, Timeline, Graph, Notes, Documents and Reminders: 14 findings to 0 (11 on the first five, 3 on Reminders).
- Consistency pass on Chat, Dashboard, Timeline, Reminders, Graph and two Settings sections (INBOX 437 (4)): Chat's message row is 36px like Capture and Ask (was 44) and its control strip, sidebar sort and More selects share the 32px control height (were 30 and 37), and the chosen chat's date line is no longer bold; the graph's zoom strip is 32px (was 34) and its options panel no longer cuts off the right column of switches; the Dashboard clock reads 8:11 like the Reminders one (was 08:11) and the name offer's two buttons are one height; today's day head on the Timeline is as tall as every other day (35px, was 47) and its count is the Graph's dock chip; Reminders' group counts are plain figures like every other group head, and from 1100px up the list no longer repeats the form's filled Add; Background jobs is a list of rows, not cards (659px, was 1,226), the file pickers match their buttons, and the four exports sit on one row with help that no longer repeats the line above it.
- Toasts: a toast fades and lets clicks through while the focused control is under it (WCAG 2.4.11; at 200% and 400% zoom a lasting "3 reminders are due" hid the Tab stop on six tabs), and the toast box no longer swallows clicks beside a narrow toast below 1100px.
- Bookmarks: pinned links lead every order but By site (the list's own sort used to discard the pin).
- Background jobs: a failed run's last-run line says why in a few words ("No space left on device", "File exists"), not the operating system's text with an error number and the path of your folders.
- Bookmarks: a test now holds that GET /bookmarks pages tile one order, pinned first across every page (it already did: the order is applied before the page is cut).
- Library: Bookmarks, By site, groups a link with no host under what it is: mailto: links under "Email", other schemes (tel:, file:) under the scheme name, instead of a section named by the raw address. The By site sort uses the same key, so a group is always one run of rows.
- Library: Contents, By month, puts each document under the month it was created in, with the notes of that month, instead of one "Documents" section after them (the other groupings keep that section). GET /documents/outline now carries `created_at`.
- Notes: a note kept on this device while the server is away now shows in the notes list, at the top, as a card marked "Waiting to save" (no actions that need the server), and the card goes when the note is sent.
- Lock: an open dialog or popover no longer stays readable over the lock screen (and no longer leaves its password field untypeable); it is put away while locked and comes back as it was after unlocking.
- Mind map: Ctrl+D on a topic copies it as the next sibling with the same words and look, and undoing it selects the parent (it used to land as a loose top-level topic).
- Backups: a manual backup that the disk refuses says why ("Couldn't save the backup: No space left on device.") instead of "Internal error".
- Documents: the outline breadcrumb starts with a "Top" mark instead of repeating the title that sits in the dock just above it.
- Mind map: Ctrl+Z after Delete on a branch brings its cross-links back (the delete response now returns the links it dropped), and the undo history no longer goes stale after a restore (ids are remapped); Shift+Tab is one undo step; undoing a create selects the parent; Tab adds a topic only after the map was clicked or keyed in, so it can leave the map (INBOX 445 (2)). Focus mode now keeps cross-linked topics in view.
- Library: Bookmarks, Contents and AI skills rebuilt inside their purpose (INBOX 445 (1)). Bookmarks: a reading list (Unread and Pinned filters with counts, opening a link reads it), a kind tile per link, "By site" groups that fold, Details in place, a note field, Move to group, Mark read and Pin on the select bar, Undo on every delete, and every page of the list (the 201st link was unreachable). Contents: the notebook as an ARIA tree with documents and their headings under them (jump to the heading), Expand all and Collapse all, arrow-key navigation and a roving tab stop. AI skills: Yours or Built-in segment with counts, a sort, "Reads only" or "Changes notes", the last run's result, Duplicate and Delete with Undo, the background workers folded away. The Library sub-tabs are sized by their words, so the gaps between labels are all 34px (they were 34 to 67).
- Background jobs: every job now shows when it last ran and how it went. Beside the control (Rebuild search index, Back up now, Find duplicates, the importers, Read my notes now, Run optimization now, Explain your existing links) a quiet line reads "Last run 2h ago · succeeded · 412 notes indexed", with the exact time and the duration on hover; a failure is the only red and says why; a running job shows the ring and "Running…". Settings, Background tasks has a new Background jobs list with every kind, the never-run ones included. The record is one row per kind in the database (so it survives a restart), written through one helper, `job_run`, from the search rebuild, the embeddings backfill, backups (manual and the daily one), the duplicate scan, imports, the night shift, the autonomous pass, resurfacing, link reasons, filing re-evaluation, model and package downloads, SearXNG setup, image captions and text reading. New route: GET /jobs/last-runs.
- Notes: making one is faster and cannot lose words. Quick note (Alt+N, or the palette) opens over any tab and saves without leaving it: caret in under 70 ms, in the list 100 to 310 ms after Ctrl+Enter, Escape keeps the words for next time, Open in Capture moves them to the full composer. A note saved while the server is not answering (Capture, Save as draft, Quick note, the dashboard's Quick capture) is kept on this device and sent by itself when the server is back (it said "Failed to fetch" and was never sent; a notice above Capture counts what is waiting, with Try now), and a resend is saved once (`client_key` on POST /entries). `#word` in the text tags the note (`inline_tags`). An image pasted into Capture and a file dropped on it are kept (both vanished). The draft keeps its title and tags through a reload (only the words came back). New note from the palette no longer starts with a blank line. The graph's new note and the dashboard's Quick capture are saved at once and filed in the background, as Capture's are. A bare link pasted into Capture or Quick note offers its page as a note through the web clipper, only while the web is allowed.
- Companion: it does what the app's AI is doing. While Atlas reads a note (Re-evaluate, Tag with Atlas, the tag offer, filing a new note, OCR) it puts its glasses on and gets its book out; while it writes (chat, Ask, Improve writing, a draft) it thinks; a caption is a look. When the work ends it nods, or holds up the note it filed, and a failure gets a puzzled face.
- Companion: double-click it and the large view shows the companion itself, still doing what it was doing (reading, asleep, sitting on its ledge) until you poke it or the act ends; in there it plays every few seconds, follows the pointer with its eyes, perks up when you hover, says its lines now and then, and only blinks under reduced motion. The view's head is the dialog-head recipe (name and an icon Close) over one line of description.
- Graph: a calmer, tidier shape. Notes of one category gather (of each dot's four nearest, 56% to 84% share its colour on a 60-note test map, as far as the links are category-shaped; a notebook whose links ignore categories keeps the old, looser layout); notes with no link take a seat on a ring that hugs the cluster, close beside their category (gap to the cluster, in typical spacings, 3.0 to 1.8); a link between two notes of one category wears that category's colour, a link with a reason is heavier, and links curve by default (Show, Curved links; turn it off to go back to straight lines); one dot size scale of 5 to 15 px with a softer glow; names are cut at a word and never end on a small word ("Fitness plan and the..." is "Fitness plan..."), the note under the pointer is named in full, and the busiest notes get ten more characters. The glide to the fitted view is instant for a reader who asked for less motion.
- OCR workspace and Tesseract: one status line under the toolbar says whether Tesseract can read (program and Python part reported separately), its version, and the language it reads in (a remembered choice that every read obeys, including the background pass); when it cannot read it names the cause and offers Install with the installer's own progress, and a read that cannot run falls to the vision model (or says what to do) and names the engine that read it. Read again really reads again (it used to do nothing once a reading existed), the reading can be edited by hand and added to an existing note, the Packages row means "can read" and shows the same language, and an OCR error points at Settings, Packages.
- Atlas's feminine look wears a flowing gown below the waist: one A-line with a softly waved hem and four folds on it, instead of five wavy ribbons hanging past a pointed hem (which read as tentacles); her comet tail is unchanged.
- Tags: a tag manager (Notes ⋯ menu, Settings, the Tags row, the command palette): every tag with its note count, rename, merge into another tag, and remove from all notes, one or several at a time, each in one transaction with a revision and an event per note (so note history shows it) and one Undo. The Notes selection bar's Tags button adds tags to and removes tags from every selected note in one action. A tag chip's right-click or menu key opens Show notes, Rename in all notes, Remove from this note and Manage tags. A category chip now opens a small menu: Show notes in the category, Move to another category, Manage categories. New routes: POST /tags/merge, /tags/bulk and /tags/restore; /tags/delete takes several names.
- The whole app is tighter and calmer: controls are 32px (were 36), the top bar 48px (was 56), interface text 14.7px where most of it inherited 16px, panels 16/20px inside, the greeting and its clock 24px; five note cards fit above the fold at 1440x900 instead of four, with a two-line preview. Toolbar buttons without a border read at a regular weight, and the dashboard's start tiles line up at the left.
- Dashboard: the first screen is calmer. Under the greeting is one row, the search box and a "..." menu holding Continue, your recent skills, Tools & features, Commands, View, Widgets and Edit layout; then the Start something tiles and your widgets. The Jump to and Run a skill rows, the four number tiles and the Your dashboard bar are gone from the page (the numbers are in the greeting, the status bar and the Stats, Streak and Writing pace widgets), and Edit layout shows a line above the widgets with its own Done.

### Fixed
- Filing: a note's certainty is now Atlas's own estimate, not the model's raw number. A small model answered 100% for a dentist appointment it filed under Work; nothing a model or a word match picks now reads above 95%, a pick the notebook's own words disagree with is lowered (under 50% shows check this and offers the other categories as one-tap buttons beside the note box), and so is a pick for a category with few notes. A note you filed yourself says Filed by you and shows no percentage.
- Notifications: about a hundred toasts for normal situations (Dictate without the voice add-on, Compress on an empty chat, Add on an empty reminder, a field left empty, nothing to export yet, a model or add-on that is off, a limit) were red with "Report this", which reads as a broken app; they are now plain toasts that ignore "mute notifications", and a failed request the server refuses with a 4xx shows plain too, so only a 5xx, a network failure or an exception keeps the red style and the report button. `toast(text, "info")` is the plain form; `tests/test_error_toasts.py` pins 100 calls and makes a new red toast with its own message name its fault.
- Status bar: with no model connected, the AI status shows the app's AI sparkle with a slash through it, in the same neutral grey on the chip, where it was a hollow ring that said nothing; the card still reads "Notebook ready · AI off", and the ready, checking, warming and error states are unchanged (INBOX 656).
- Chat, Ask, the popup agent, the Guide and persona rows: Atlas's small head (under 28px) is now a miniature of the current bust, both looks: the head mark's hair, cap and fringe, eyes with an iris, pupil and catchlight, the ears, and the neck and shoulders, where it was a bald egg with two solid ink eyes and a heavy outline (INBOX 650).
- Packaged builds: both PyInstaller specs now leave any __pycache__ folder out of the bundle (migrations/ is copied whole, so a build machine that had run the app shipped stale bytecode there).
- Internal, after the motion-polish and map and icon branches merged: the icon picker's stylesheet and script are one `LAZY_MODULES.iconPicker` bundle loaded with `ensureModule`, its tile hover follows the Interface animations switch, and the map's and picker's caches are one const each, so the lazy-CSS, motion-token and global-scope ratchets hold at their caps.
- Windows start.bat: a folder name containing ! (Notes!, Hi!there) no longer breaks the launcher; the script's own path is read before delayed expansion is turned on, so MM_HOME, MM_SELF and the first cd keep the character. Reasoned and statically tested only, no Windows machine was available.
- Windows updates: the in-app update now reopens MemoryMap AI by itself when the installer finishes (it passes /RELAUNCH=1 and only a silent install honours it, so a scripted /VERYSILENT install still opens nothing); before, the app closed for the update and stayed closed until the person opened it again. Reasoned and statically tested only, no Windows machine was available.
- Windows: the Start Menu's Repair MemoryMap AI no longer half-deletes the window's cache under a running copy (WebView2 holds those files locked, so only the unlocked half went); with the app open it leaves the cache alone and says to quit first.
- Windows uninstaller: answering yes to deleting the optional packages now deletes the ones the app downloaded itself too (Pyodide, the needle model, in the extras folder), not only the pip packages.
- Windows installer: it reads its version from the app's own __version__ instead of a MEMORYMAP_VERSION variable with a hard-coded 0.1.0 fallback, and a release tag that disagrees with the code stops the release before anything is built. An upgrade removes the previous build's program files before copying the new ones, so no file an older version had (a moved module, a DLL from another Python) is left beside the new one, and the uninstaller removes anything the app wrote inside its own folder.
- Windows launcher: start.bat --shortcut puts the shortcut on the Desktop you see when OneDrive has moved it (on by default on many new PCs), where it used to fail or land in a folder nobody looked at, and works from a folder whose path has an apostrophe (C:\Users\O'Brien); uninstall.bat --shortcuts looks in the same place.
- Desktop window: an edited lazily loaded stylesheet (the Library's library-lazy.css) is fetched fresh. It was stamped with app.js's hash, a URL cached for a year, so a change to it alone kept the old rules in the window's long-lived cache; every stylesheet now carries its own hash in the page's stamp map.
- Packaged app: /capabilities no longer offers 'python -m memorymap.mcp_server' as installed. The packaged app has no Python to run it with, so an outside client set up from that answer failed to start; it says so now, and the install guide says the MCP server runs from a source checkout.
- Packaged app: optional packages install against the app's own version limits again (requirements.txt is bundled; the packaged build looked for it outside the bundle and installed unconstrained), and on the packaged Linux app a package with a compiled part (Export to Word, scanned PDFs) installs at all: pip was asked for wheels tagged linux_x86_64, which nobody publishes, and now also gets the manylinux tags this machine runs.
- Packaged app: optional packages installed after setup find the standard library they need. The bundle carried only the standard modules the app itself imports, and search by meaning (transformers needs filecmp), scanned PDFs (ctypes.util) and others import more; the whole standard library is bundled now except Tk, the tests and IDLE, about 3 MB.
- Packaged app: nothing is written inside the install folder any more. Once migrations ran, the frozen interpreter cached them as bytecode beside the exe, which no uninstall removed; a packaged build now writes no bytecode.
- Windows: saving preferences or the instance lock no longer fails when an antivirus scan or a second launch has the file open for a moment. The rename Windows refuses then is tried again for up to about three seconds, and these files are always written as UTF-8.
- Windows: the tray's Restart brings the installed app back. Python's exec on Windows passes the arguments unquoted, so the program's own path (MemoryMap AI\MemoryMap AI.exe) arrived as three arguments and the restarted app exited at once; it starts a new process now, and a Restart after the Repair shortcut no longer repairs again. Quit, Restart, the console switch and an update now let go of the notebook's lock before exiting, so the next launch never waits on a lock naming a dead or reused process.
- Packaged app: no traceback in the log on every launch. The launcher asked for the bootloader's splash, which the build has not had since 0.3.3, and the module prints a traceback on its way to failing; it is asked for now only when the bootloader made one.
- Packaged app: tool calling without Ollama (the needle extra) works in the installed build. Its provider is imported by name, which PyInstaller cannot see, so it was one of two app modules missing from the bundle (measured, 198 of 200); both specs now list every module of the app by file, and a test checks the list against every import by name.
- Packaged app: the database is stamped and upgraded by Alembic again on a Japanese, Chinese or Korean Windows (and the frozen app under a C locale). alembic.ini carried one em dash, which Alembic reads in the system's own encoding, so the step failed before any migration ran; the file is plain ASCII now and a test keeps it so.
- Test sweeps: the skeleton sweep treats a view whose empty answer is its boot answer (the chat list) as expected, and the boot-time sweep now reports DOMContentLoaded, first contentful paint and when the dashboard is readable over five cold loads; the Library and Documents "blank" skeletons were a sweep timing artifact, not the app.
- Filing: when the chat model files a note, the prompt now also names the three notes already filed that read most like it with their categories, and any refile correction that reads like it (private notes are never named, and the note being re-filed is not its own example). The corrections switch in Learned silences it. Before, only the categories you had moved notes into were mentioned.
- Desktop launch: a MemoryMap already on the port is reused only when it serves this launch's data folder; a second copy pointed at a different folder is treated as another program and the window moves to the next free port, where before it opened onto the wrong notebook. The server reports a hash of its resolved folder (never the path) at the new open `GET /instance`, compared case-insensitively on Windows; a build too old to answer is still reused, as before.
- Whiteboard between 641 and 819px: the tool dock no longer overlaps the zoom cluster (6,841px² to 0) and the top bar is one row from 680; the whiteboard file's last ten off-band widths moved onto the 819.98/820 band and their allowances left `tests/test_breakpoints.py` (`op5-1005.js` MODE=bands).
- Settings, Models: an installed model's menu offers only the uses its kind has (an embedding model is offered Use for search, never Use for chat; a vision model images, reading text and chat), read from the catalogue, then Ollama's model details, then the name (`model_cards.installed_uses`, `tests/test_model_cards.py`, `op5-1005.js` MODE=models).
- Settings, Skills and Personas: the "Built-in" label on a list row is readable in light (4.27:1 before, three tints stacked under muted type); it takes the ink, as the "Installed" label already did.
- Test suite: each pytest-xdist worker no longer climbs to 2 to 2.7 GB (four of them filled a 16 GB CI runner, which shut down at 96 to 99%). FastAPI's callable caches kept every test's app alive (about 8 MB each) and are now cleared after each test, and the 145 test modules that read a frontend file at import now share one copy of it (collection RSS 490 to 341 MB). Measured per worker at the end of the suite: about 1 GB before the second change, down from 2 to 2.7 GB.
- The guided tour no longer counts steps it cannot show on a tablet-width window (600 to 819 wide, or a touch screen): the chat sidebar is a sheet parked off screen there and the status bar's Commands item is hidden, so those two cards are left out of the count instead of being planned and dropped ("3 of 4" with three shown). The no-mind-map card is shorter (115 characters, was 209).
- Whiteboards and mind maps: the Board menu closes when Export, Clear, Add to a note, Map to document, Copy app link or Delete is pressed. It stayed open over the dialog or picker the row had just opened, and on a phone (390 wide) it covered the note picker's rows so the first one could not be pressed. Measured: all six left it open before, none after.
- Settings, Skills and Personas: the "Built-in" label on a list row is readable in light (4.27:1 before, three tints stacked under muted type); it takes the ink, as the "Installed" label already did.
- A whiteboard or mind map in a note no longer reads "This board is no longer in your notebook" when the note is drawn a second time while the first look for the board is still on its way: the second card now waits for that look instead of treating it as an answer. Measured with a board made a second before its note was opened: the card drew as removed in every run before, and as the board in every run after (`noteobject.js`).
- Alignment and loading: a Timeline row's kind mark, title and time sit on one line (the mark was 1.2px above the title in a one-line row), and the Settings lists that fill from a request (Packages and its embedding models, Skills, Tools, Personas, Backups, Privacy, Account) show skeleton rows while they load instead of a blank space (INBOX 542, 596).
- Settings: Models, What it remembers, What it learned and the Logs list show placeholder rows while their first answer is on its way, instead of a bare "Checking the models…" line or an empty pane; Models paints the last known status the moment Settings opens.
- Capture: the formatting strip is the one-row folded bar from its first paint on a phone (it drew two rows, 104px, and folded to 54px when the Library code loaded, a jump under the thumb).
- Note facts turned to their icons (a narrow column such as Ask's matching notes) are 24px squares with the icon centred. They kept the words' minimum width and side padding, so the links icon sat 4.5px left of centre in a 30 by 24 box (`iconchip.js`: now 24 by 24, 0px off).
- Private notes: a private note's card no longer offers "Tag with Atlas" (the chip under an untagged note). The route refuses a private note, so the chip's only answer was a refusal toast; the note menu's AI actions group was already left out for one. Measured: a private untagged note drew 1 chip before and draws 0 now, a plain one still draws 1 (`open-privatechip.js`; `tests/test_private_note_no_ai_offer.py`).
- Loading: the first visit to Graph, Library and Documents shows the page's own outline (its bar, then the map, the tiles, or the list and the open page) instead of a blank screen with a line across the middle, and if it takes more than a moment it says "Opening the graph…" with a moving ring. Dashboard widgets load as skeleton rows rather than the word Loading, and going back to the dashboard keeps it on screen while it refreshes instead of showing it empty for a second (INBOX 598, 596, 602).
- Learned from your notes: turning off "Open questions" now stops the night pass collecting questions and matching them to later answers (the questions already collected stay listed). Before, the switch was stored and shown but gated nothing.
- Note properties: saving a note's properties, and turning a plain mention into a link from a note's Backlinks, failed with an error since the entries API learned If-Match; both save again.
- Settings: every on/off row is one shape. The switches written as a `.check-row` (15 in Settings) sat 6.4px from their labels against 9.6px on the `.setting-check` rows beside them; both are 9.6px now, and the SearXNG autostart row leads with its switch in the reading order as it already did on screen (`togglerows.js`, one shape at 1440 and 390, light and dark).
- Library: the Files sub-tab asks for a PDF's first page only when this install can draw one. Without the PDF render extra each document row used to request a page that could only fail (four 404s per render on a notebook with four PDFs); the server now says per row whether a page can be drawn (`has_pages` on `GET /media`, and on the attachment gallery only with the extra) and the row keeps its type icon otherwise (`pdfpagereq.js`, 0 requests without the extra, 0 404s with it, at 1440 and 390, light and dark).
- Documents: the word menu keeps its full width wherever it opens. A short menu left near the right edge and then opened on a word with a long suggestion measured itself squeezed against the edge (256px of its 316 at phone width) and was placed from that; it is now measured from the left edge first (`wordmenuwidth.js`, 5 of 5 at 1440 and 390, light and dark).
- Graph: notes move at an even speed while the map settles (INBOX 586, "the graph is a little jittery when nodes move around or adjust position"). The layout's steps and the screen's frames ran on two clocks, so a note moved two steps in one frame and none in the next; each frame now draws the point between the last two steps that its time says. Simulated at 60 frames a second: per-frame steps vary by 13% instead of 34%, and on a large map every frame moves instead of one in four.
- Graph: clicking a note moves nothing (INBOX 587, "when I click nodes on the graph, it moves the graph slightly??"). A press on a note used to start a drag at once, which reheated the layout, so every click set its neighbours moving; a drag now begins only after the pointer travels 3px. Measured on ten clicks: other notes moved 15 to 65px before, 0 after, and the view did not move.
- Mind maps: a core topic's Dashed edge bar is dashed (INBOX 581, "the solid and dashed bar are exactly the same on mind map nodes"). A border's gaps show the box's own ground, and a core topic's ground is its branch colour, the bar's colour, so its Dashed bar drew solid; the gaps now show the board. Every Box (Rounded, Pill, Box, Ellipse), free, pinned, core and filled, in right, down and both-sides maps: Solid continuous and Dashed with gaps in all 64, light and dark (core was 2 of 16 before).
- Chat: the Chats sidebar's head is one quiet row, the way the Notes sidebar's is (INBOX 578, "this section in the chat sidebar looks awkward"): the title, then the sort as an icon picker and New chat as an icon button, both ghost, beside the collapse toggle. It was a filled New button and a wide Recent field alone on a row under the head. Measured: one row, every control 32px on one centre line, nothing filled, at 170 to 520px sidebar widths; at the narrowest the sort leaves the head (sorting is then in the Library) rather than cutting the title.
- Graph: Tree, Radial and Arc draw again on a notebook with replies (INBOX 579, "switching the graph layout does nothing"). The map now lists notes newest first, so a reply came before the note it answers and the layout stopped on an error before drawing; the layouts no longer depend on the order, and a reply chain that loops is filed under its category. Measured on 142 notes: every pair of layouts was 0 apart with three errors, now 21 to 110 apart (of 100) with none, canvas and SVG, light and dark, at 1440 and 390.
- Icons beside words sit on the words' capital-letter centre in whatever font the app is drawn in (INBOX 592): badges such as Fits and Installed, a note's facts line (category, score, tags, date), menu rows and buttons. On Windows the icons sat up to 1.7px off and the date 1.3px off the chips beside it; the "+N more links" button is now the same pill as the links beside it.
- Notes: the Connections column's help and close buttons are one size and on one line (the close button was smaller and sat 2px lower).
- Narrow windows (600 to 820 wide, an iPad upright): one layout across the whole band. Settings shows its sections as a strip above one full-width column (the settings had 282px beside the section list at 620), the dashboard is two cards across, a note's actions are one row (they stood in a column below 720), and the top bar is one height; the leftover 720, 640 and 900 pixel layouts now change at 600 or 820 like the rest of the app.
- Phone: Escape on a ⋯ menu's action sheet closes the sheet. Before, the sheet stayed up and the Escape closed what was under it, the Settings window included (found by INBOX 595's sweep).
- Mind maps: the "Point a new node at…" picker (and every notebook picker on its shell) is redesigned (INBOX 572). With more rows than fit, each row shrank to 28px and its 32px icon hung over the next row's title; every row is now 56px with the icon centred and 8px between rows. The sources span the dialog as equal segments, each with its count (what matches the words typed), Home and End walk them, and the picker opens on the source you used last. A bookmark's icon says what it points at and a file's its type, titles are clipped by the row's width rather than at 70 characters, nothing matching is an empty state with an icon and a title, the search ring is the one 2px ring, and the list keeps one height and a thin scrollbar with no arrows.
- Agent mode and skills: a small model that writes a lookup into its reply as text, like list_notes({...}), now has the lookup run instead of stopping with "I cannot execute the tool call"; changes written the same way still are not run.
- Notes, Ask: the text-selection menu no longer pops up over an answer's sources when the answer selects your question for re-typing.
- Moving a note the AI filed to another category now teaches the next filing: the move was recorded but never read back, so the same note kept being filed in the same wrong place.
- Phone: More has a Commands row that opens the command palette, which a phone had no way to reach.
- Notes: switching on "Connections beside an open note" with no note open says that the column shows beside a note once you open one (INBOX 546).
- Settings: every section with three or more groups opens with its "In this section" strip under its title; Tasks had it at the bottom (after Quit MemoryMap) and short sections had none (INBOX 541).
- Graph, Arc view: it opens framed whole, its arcs and end labels inside the window with a margin, instead of zoomed in on the bare baseline near the top (INBOX 544).
- Notes, Capture: the Clear button sits below the text box instead of over its bottom edge (6px over at desktop width, 14px on a phone) (INBOX 545).
- Top bar: the tabs no longer jump sideways when you switch tab; the strip was measured with its sliding highlight counted as a tab, so whether it was centred depended on which tab was selected (INBOX 539).
- Agent mode: a model that can call tools is no longer reported as unable to after one tool call Ollama could not read; the request is made once more, only Ollama's own "does not support tools" counts as no tools, an error mid-answer is said instead of ending empty, and a model that claims tools but keeps failing gets its own message (INBOX 538).

- Mind maps: a map's theme with an impossibly large text size in it (JSON's 1e999, from a hand-edited file or another client) is dropped like any other bad value; before, saving it was a server error, and since the theme is read on every open of the map, a stored one would have broken the map (the final scan, 2026-10-06).
- Mind maps: the + on a map line is one Undo step that puts the branch back under its parent; Redo brings the new topic back between them; any topic taken back by Undo comes back under its parent on Redo, and a batch redoes in the right order (INBOX 537).
Graph: a topic summary request's shared terms are capped at 200 characters each.
Suggestions: a decision's signal names are capped at 40 characters (they are kept in the learning table for good).
Agent: a small model's runaway bracket (thousands of [ or { in one tool argument) failed that one call as unreadable JSON; it raised RecursionError past every reader and ended the whole turn.
Logs: the query-string redaction was quadratic in a line with a ? early and a long run of slashes after it (28,000 slashes took 2.4 s on the thread that writes every log line); it reads each run once.
Privacy: making a note private drops the people and places a model had read out of it (the notes filter's entity: term and the graph still answered with a private note's names); made readable again, it is read again.
- Graph: the options panel (676px of list in a 492px panel at 1440x900) already scrolled inside itself and now keeps the wheel there: a wheel at the end of the list no longer chains to the map behind it (`overscroll-behavior: contain`; on a phone the sheet is the scroller and already contained). Sweep `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphoptfit.js`.
- A private note's kept tag suggestions and discarded tags are handled like its tags: shown wherever its tags are and nowhere else (search, the graph, the model's context, exports and every locked read were checked together), and filing no longer makes new suggestions for a private note from its text (`tests/test_private_suggested_tags.py`).
- `[[Target|Shown]]` means the same everywhere: the note it links to is the part before the bar, whether the link is made on save, listed in a document or note's backlinks, or shown as "links to it" in a note's references; and a note's label, preview and graph line read the shown words, not "Target|Shown" (`manager.wiki_target`, `wiki_shown`, `wiki_plain`).
/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-MemoryMap-AI/eac0a178-6a5f-55a9-b7c8-87cedc9b90ca/scratchpad/cl-wisps.txt
/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-MemoryMap-AI/eac0a178-6a5f-55a9-b7c8-87cedc9b90ca/scratchpad/cl-aura.txt
Library: a note or document with a long run of blank lines or spaces no longer freezes the app: 1,000 blank lines made the Library list take 6.5 seconds and 2,000 took 49, because the preview's table-rule pattern was cubic in the run; 20,000 of any shape is now instant.
Privacy: saving a setting no longer copies a name, a dictionary of your words or a whole skill into the activity log; only short plain values are recorded.
Security: the link opener, page clipper and other outbound fetches now refuse the shared address space (100.64.0.0/10, which includes Tailscale nodes and a cloud metadata service at 100.100.100.200) as they already refused home-network addresses.
Privacy: saving an edit to a private note kept its new text encrypted only in the editor's eyes (it was written to the database in plain text while the note stayed marked private, and into the search index); it is now stored encrypted, and Add context, which appended plain words to the encrypted text and made the note unreadable, refuses a private note.
Privacy: making a note private now encrypts the history it already had (its first version and earlier edits sat in the event log and the version list in plain text); restoring an older version fits the note as it is now, so a version saved while private no longer comes back as unreadable text in a note that has since been made public.
- Chat: the transcript keeps following a long answer as it is written. A heading, list or code block landing between two frames made it stop following, so the end ran away from you and only "Jump to latest" caught up; a picture arriving late or a fold collapsing now keeps you at the bottom too.
- Chat: with a local server that speaks the OpenAI dialect (LM Studio, llama.cpp), an answer now writes itself live; it used to arrive all at once at the end of the turn.
- Ask: Tab off either end of a pinned source preview closes it and puts the focus back on its mark, instead of leaving it open at the end of the page until Escape.
- Chips: the Contents jump chips, the dashboard's On this day dates, the chat sources' +N, document property and embed chips and the Library's reading badges put their words in the same trimmed span as every other chip, so they sit level with their neighbours.
- Skill logs: Clear and the pin button no longer touch when the collapsed sidebar is peeked open (they overlapped by 5.6px; the peeked pin now sits where the pinned one does, 6.4px from Clear), and at phone width Clear sits 6.4px from the opener, up from 2.4px (INBOX 495).
- Locking the notebook no longer deletes the Timeline's feed and table or the Reminders controls (it emptied their containers, not only the rows), so the Notes select button stops throwing `Cannot read properties of null` from `paintTimeline` after a lock; a lint now fails if a purged container holds an id (INBOX 492).
- Mind maps: the board's Insert and Arrange buttons no longer show in a map's top bar when one of their menus was open as the map opened.
- Quick sketch: the toolbar stays on one row at tablet width with Large text; the ink dots sit closer between 600 and 1023px wide.
- Mind maps: the topic menu's "Connect this topic to another" picks the connect tool again; it did nothing.
- Mind maps: Tab, a name and Enter typed before the new topic's editor has opened now name that topic; the Enter used to add a second, empty topic and the name was lost.
- Search results open from the keyboard (Tab to one, Enter or Space), and the sidebars' "All in Library" link fits on one line.
- Whiteboard and mind map, audited (INBOX 445): M picks the highlighter without opening the quick-nav guide (which swallowed the stroke, and M then D left the board); a map's letters no longer pick hidden board tools; Escape leaves a text box selected; the shape Fill switch draws filled shapes when on (it was inverted); the tool bar shows only the settings the held tool uses; Ctrl+Shift+arrows move a topic among its siblings, Enter adds the new topic right after the current one and Shift+Enter right before it, Ctrl+Z brings back a deleted branch with its styling, undo keeps 100 steps; what you type straight after Tab or Enter is the new topic's text; Tab walks a board's items from the keyboard, each one announced, and Select all takes pictures; group and branch drags no longer re-measure the board every frame.
- A note card's time stays on screen when you point at the card (it faded out to make room for the buttons), at the right of the details line, and says "edited" when the note has been.
- With no AI running, Ask answers "What have I saved recently?" with your newest notes and when each was written, each cited, instead of saying the notes did not match the question.
- Companion on Chat: it perches on the composer dock, reads along on it while an answer is written and cheers when it lands, and never covers the input, Send, Stop or the latest message (Atlas's tail hung over Stop and the input). A double-click no longer pokes it first, and with reduced motion a move is a crossfade rather than a fade to nothing and back.
- On a phone a note's suggested tags are 24px chips again: each one's dismiss button had grown into a 44px grey disc. The graph labels a note by its first line, not its title run into its body. The document sidebar's Documents/Outline tabs keep their underline in the Paper, Utilitarian and Mono looks. Recently added on the dashboard can be opened from the keyboard. The Reminders form is one height with every other form.
- A note's history says whose each change was: You, Atlas, or You and Atlas (a save that includes an applied Improve writing suggestion), with the exact time on hover; any earlier version can be put back.
- Selected text, Search the notebook: says which notes it is showing, with Clear, instead of filtering the list silently.
- A note's details line has room again: where it is filed and how sure, its tags, then what points at it, 16px apart (they sat 6px apart, overlapping, in the Notes list).
- The graph's note popup renders markdown and pictures again: choosing Source in Capture had switched every note box to raw markdown, including the popup, which has no Source button to switch back.
- Selected text, Save as a note: says "Saving…" at once and "Saved as a note" with Open when done, and files in the background instead of waiting on the model.
- Ask, Chat and the weekly digest know what a note's time words meant: "this Friday" in a note written two weeks ago reaches the model as "Friday 25 September 2026, 8 days ago", not as this week's Friday.
- "What have I saved recently?" (and "what did I write lately") lists your newest notes instead of searching for the word "saved".
- A picture in a note stays visible while you edit its line (under its markdown), so the graph popup's Edit no longer turns a sketch into a bare link.
- Loading placeholders show the shape of what is coming (a title line and a text line) with a visible sweep; with reduced motion they breathe gently instead of sitting blank.
- The tags list under a tags field lights the row under the pointer, and Enter or Tab takes a row reached with the arrows or the pointer.
- Settings, Templates, Skills and Personas: Edit, Reset and Delete sit in their own column, centred on the item and always shown (they were hidden until pointed at and hugged the card's top corner); the Built-in label is one line beside the name.
- Badges: "Built-in", "Edited", "Yours" and the Models sliders' "you set this" are drawn one way everywhere (the Library's skill cards showed bare text and the sliders a third style); the Library's skill facts are one height.
- Privacy: the search-by-meaning model goes online only to download itself the first time; once on this computer it loads from disk with no connection, and if its files will not load it says to reinstall it instead of quietly fetching it again.
- Settings, Models: double-clicking a slider to reset it also resets its "you set this" badge, and the value no longer shows twice.
- Loading: the Library's documents, boards and maps, images and files, AI skills, bookmarks and contents, Reminders, the chat list and the documents sidebar show placeholder rows while their data loads, instead of a blank area.
- Tags fields (Capture and editing a note): the browser's dropdown arrow and list are replaced by the app's own list, under the field at its width, completing the tag after the last comma, leaving out tags already entered, showing how many notes use each; arrow keys, Enter, Tab and Escape work.
- A note nothing could file offers its likely categories as one-tap buttons beside Choose category; a note filed from your notebook's words says so.
- The AI status dot's "checking" dots sit in the middle of the dot (they were 3px off).
- The AI status popup and the header's menus stand above the companion when it is perched on their bar.
- Settings, Models says it is checking while the model status loads and that a slow model server is slow, instead of "Can't reach the MemoryMap server" while the app is running.
- The needle extra's note says plainly that it runs offline and that nothing needs doing about telemetry.
- Notes: Ctrl+Shift+N, the dashboard's New note and the empty states always open Capture with the caret in the box; with Notes last on Browse the shortcut used to focus nothing, and what you typed next was lost.
- Filing with no AI: a new note is filed from your notebook's own words (the notes already in each category, their tags, your moves by hand and the category names), says so ("filed from your notebook's words"), and stays in Uncategorised when it is not sure; before, every note went to Uncategorised whenever no model was running.
- Accessibility: Settings, Keyboard shortcuts has a switch for single-key shortcuts (the m chord, / and ?), so speech input or a stray key cannot trigger them (WCAG 2.1.4).
- Zoom and keyboard: at 400% zoom or on a very short window the sub-tab strips scroll with the page and New note stays in its dock, so a focused control is never hidden under them; a closed sidebar drawer is no longer a Tab stop; a control reached by Tab scrolls clear of the floating button and the sticky strip.
- Keyboard: F2 or Edit puts the caret in the note's editor and Escape returns to the note; a chooser sheet (Move to category, Tags) opens on the current row and the arrow keys walk its rows; after a move the focus stays on the note instead of falling to the top of the page.
- Accessibility: Find anything's results are announced as a list only while they list something; its empty and no-match messages no longer read as an empty list.
- A dropdown's list is never narrower than the control that opened it (Library "Items per page", the Timeline's options, Sort notes).
- A chip's leading icon sits level with its words (the clock on the "Ask again" chips sat 1.5px high).
- The Web search panel's "..." menu is there the moment the panel opens, instead of after the engine's status check.
- A note card's labels row keeps the same room under the text as under "Show more".
- Timeline: on a day with notes, today's count stays at the end of its heading like every other day's, with "Start today's note" just before it, instead of floating in the middle.
- Reminders: the 15 min and 1 day steppers sit right after Quick set, with the time they add up to after them, and no longer move when Reset appears.
- Accessibility: sidebar and panel resize grips say how wide the panel is; the document editor and every note box have a name; Library chip counts and the Web toggle meet 4.5:1 contrast; dashboard rows that are buttons are announced as a group; Capture, persona and template fields have labels, not only placeholders.
- Companion: perched on a chat message, a library card or a note card, it now scrolls under the top bar with its perch instead of staying in front of it (62px of figure over the bar before, 103px at Large); perched on the bar itself it stays in front.
- Companion: the palette row says Hide companion or Show companion, whichever it will do, and the hide toast names the shortcut as currently bound.
- Accessibility: the app has one main landmark around its tab pages, so a screen reader's jump to main content works on every tab (it found nothing on five).
- Status bar: below 1024px wide the page no longer scrolls sideways while a background job runs; the key hint goes and Ask, Guide, Find, reminders and the running count show their icon and number, their words still read to a screen reader.
- Notes: a filter still being typed (`tag:`, `in:`, `#`) no longer empties the list until its value is typed.
- Notes: Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter) saves from the capture box and from a note being edited, and the caret stays in the box after a save, so the next thought goes straight in.
- A note no AI could file says so once, "Saved in Uncategorised: no AI model is running to file it", with Choose category beside it, instead of "Filed under Uncategorised (0% sure)" twice.
- A note being edited keeps what you typed when the list redraws (a star pressed elsewhere, a filter, a background filing); Escape and Cancel ask before dropping changes, and an emptied note is refused rather than quietly kept.
- Selecting notes, then changing category or filter, no longer leaves hidden notes selected for Tag or Delete.
- A to Z sorts by a note's title, with "note 2" before "note 10"; the sort is remembered.
- The Notes sidebar lights one row at a time, lists categories with no notes yet, sorts names the way people read them, and every row is reachable by keyboard; its fold is remembered.
- In "All spaces", moving or renaming a category never files a note under another space's category; category counts match the notes list; tags are stored once each, whatever their case.
- The Connections column lists a note's own [[links]], and "Forgotten, and close to this" never lists drafts or unrelated notes.
- The popup agent with a small model: a reply that only says what it will do ("I'll count the notes in Work") is asked once to do it, and the model's quoting markers no longer show in answers.
- Settings: Import .md files works again; the search engine line says how many notes search by meaning can find and how the last search found its notes; Chat's Web and Plan pills keep their icon when on.
- Boards and mind maps: dragging the overview's view box keeps up with the pointer (a 150-card board at a 4x slowed CPU: 183 to 33ms a frame at the 95th percentile, long tasks 61 to 0 to 3), and Fit is two to three times smoother.
- Phone: tapping a note opens it; the categories drawer is one column of full-width rows that closes on a choice; a toast no longer covers the New note button.
- The command palette (Ctrl+K) finds "Manage categories", "Go to category: X", a #tag, and Move to category for the note in hand.
- Asking for "my last note" (or latest, newest, what I wrote last) lists your newest notes newest first instead of searching for the words; Chat and Ask now tell the model when each note was written and last edited.
- The rows view is one line per note (47px a row, was 74).
- Note boxes (Capture and editing a note) render as you type with a Source switch for the markdown, in place of a separate Preview; the switch stays visible with the formatting tools folded and is remembered.

### Added
- Whiteboards and mind maps: drag a card, a text box, a shape or a topic (or the selection it belongs to) onto "Drop here to delete", which appears at the foot of the canvas while something is carried, to delete it as one Undo step, with a toast offering Undo; a topic takes its branch, as its Delete does. Escape or a drop anywhere else leaves it a plain move, and Delete still works from the keyboard (INBOX 660).
- Mind maps: a topic can have a due day (the Markers popover's Due row): drawn in the marker row, a day gone in red and read as was due, filterable, kept by OPML and FreeMind, and Remind me makes a reminder at 9:00 that day (MINDMAP_PLAN decision 37; `tests/test_mindmap.py`, `op5-1005.js` MODE=due).
- Mind maps: Study the map (the board menu, or the palette) asks one branch at a time with what is under it hidden; Show draws it, Knew it or Not yet marks it, and the marks are kept for that map on this device (MINDMAP_PLAN decision 36; `tests/test_map_study.py`, `op5-1005.js` MODE=study).
- Mind maps: export as a plain-text outline (a tab per level) and import a .txt outline; an outline file dropped on the boards page imports and opens (MINDMAP_PLAN §12.2 item 10; `tests/test_mindmap.py`, `op5-1005.js` MODE=mapio).

- Chat, skill runs: "Undo the run" beside What changed puts back every note the run changed at once, after showing what will go back; each change keeps its own Undo, and a board item is named as one that can't be undone.
- Settings, Packages: "Read images without Tesseract (RapidOCR)", a second local reader for pictures and scanned pages with nothing else to install. It reads when Tesseract isn't ready; Tesseract stays the reader whenever it is. The Vision bundle installs both, and the OCR workspace names whichever one read.
- Documents: in Live, drag the corner of a picture to resize it, or focus the corner and use the arrow keys, and its align button puts it on the left, in the centre or on the right; the size and alignment are written into the picture's markdown, so Read, a print and the exports show the same picture (DOCUMENTS_PLAN decision 8, the audit's D5).
- Documents: Print or save as PDF first asks for the page size (A4 or Letter), orientation, margins and whether to print page numbers with the title at the head of each page, and remembers it; a plain Ctrl+P prints on the same page (DOCUMENTS_PLAN decision 7, the audit's D4).
- Documents: a ```mermaid flowchart (flowchart or graph, in any direction, with boxes, rounds, diamonds and circles, labelled and dotted or thick links) draws as a diagram in Read, in Live while the caret is elsewhere, in a print and in the HTML export, by the app's own parser with nothing downloaded; press it in Live to edit its text; any other Mermaid diagram stays as code (DOCUMENTS_PLAN decision 20.6, the audit's D3).
- Documents: the menu's Map the headings (and the palette) makes a new mind map of the document's headings, laid out as a tree, with a topic that opens the document again; a heading inside a code block is left out (MINDMAP_PLAN decision 35, the audit's M5).
- Mind maps: markers on a topic, a priority from 1 to 5, how far along it is, a flag and up to six icons (from the app's own icon set, never emoji), drawn before its name and set from the topic's menu (Content, Markers) or the palette; View, Filter by marker dims every topic without the one you pick; OPML and FreeMind exports carry them (MINDMAP_PLAN decision 34, the audit's M4).
- Mind maps: View, Outline shows the map as an indented list beside it, edited in place: type to rename (the canvas follows as you type), Enter adds a topic, Tab and Shift+Tab move it in and out a level, Backspace on an empty topic removes it, Escape goes back to the map; the palette has the same row (MINDMAP_PLAN decision 33, the audit's M3).
- Notes: the filter is:review lists the filings to check, notes Atlas filed with little confidence or left in Uncategorised, each with Accept (keep its category, with Undo), Refile and Split; the dashboard's Categories widget says how many wait, and the palette has Show filings to check (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 17).
- Graph: View, Colour, Note type paints each note by its type (Meeting, Book, your own), with "No type" in grey; a type's colour is chosen in Note types, its ⋯, Colour…, and Automatic is the colour the picker previews (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN row 10, D5).
- Timeline: in the feed, Ctrl and the mouse wheel, or a trackpad pinch, makes the date groups finer or coarser (day, week, month, year), one step per gesture, keeping your place; + and - on a row do the same. Options, Time range has On this day: what you wrote on today's date in earlier months and years, in your own time zone (TIMELINE_PLAN decisions 11 and 12).
- Dashboard, Tensions: the widget now lists the disagreements already found and not yet decided (by a review or the overnight pass), each with both notes, what it is about, and which model found it when, with buttons to open either note, link the two as contradicting, or dismiss the pair. A review keeps what it finds and never asks the model about the same pair twice, and the review sheet shows what is waiting before you start (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN B4, row 18).
- Notes, a live query's Table: the last row rolls each column up over every matching note (not only the rows drawn): Count, and Sum, Min and Max for numbers, Earliest and Latest for dates, the choice kept per column. A note field in Properties (and in a document's properties) has a magnifier that searches your notes, where before only the first 300 titles were offered (GRAPH_PLAN, the last KG rows; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/kg1005-rollups.js` 8/8 at 1440 light and 390 dark).
- Polish in use (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN H9): Settings, General, Simple mode shows only Dashboard, Notes, Chat and Library (every hidden place still opens from the palette); What you use counts the tabs and palette commands you use, on this computer only and never sent anywhere, lists what has not been used in 90 days, and the palette puts your most used commands first; `memorymap --capture` bound to a key in your system's keyboard settings opens a one-line capture box over any app (Settings, Keyboard shortcuts, Capture from anywhere has the command; a note was saved and listed 606 ms after the box opened); a pause while typing a question warms the search for it, and focus in Capture, Ask or chat starts loading a search model that is not loaded yet, which took the first answer on a fresh install from 15.5 s to 11.5 s of the app's own time (most of what is left is that model's first load on a busy sandbox). A perf budget runs with the suite on every push (`tests/test_perf_budget.py`: statement and time budgets on ten boot routes); the sweeps gained a fault pass (29 routes failed one at a time, no tab left blank), a keyboard reach pass and the axe pass in `all.sh` (WCAG 2.2 AA, every tab and Settings section: 0 findings at 1440 light and dark; at 390 the Timeline table's rows carried aria-expanded, which a plain table does not allow, and the table is a treegrid now, 0 findings after).
- Settings, Import & export, Import from another app: From Notion (the Markdown & CSV export zip), From Obsidian (the vault folder), From Evernote (.enex) and From Apple Notes (an exporter's folder). Folders and notebooks become categories, tags and created dates come along, links between Notion pages become wiki links, and a second import of the same export adds nothing twice and says how many were already here; one step with Undo, like the other imports. Evernote files are read with entity expansion refused (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN H6, 5.7; `POST /import/app`, `entry/app_import.py`, `tests/test_app_import.py`). Keyboard: every visible dock control on all seven tabs is reached by Tab, measured (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/inv1005-keyreach.js`: 45 controls at 1440, 31 at 390, none missed).
- Web clipper, from your own browser: Settings, Import & export, Web clipper has a Clip to MemoryMap bookmark to drag to the bookmarks bar. Pressed on any page it opens a small MemoryMap window with the page's title and address, and Save as a note keeps its main text, or only what you selected. Nothing is fetched (it works with web search off and on pages you signed in to see), no extension is needed, and the same page clipped twice points to the note it made the first time. A clipped note keeps its address, so Atlas treats it as text from outside, and a retrieved note from outside is now fenced as one in the prompt (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D9; `POST /links/clip-page`, `clip.html`, `tests/test_webclip_page.py`).
- Documents: the margin reader. Turn it on from the dock menu's While you write, Margin reader, and a column beside the editor shows at most three cards about the paragraph you are in, a moment after you stop typing: Repeats, Differs (the same thing with a different number or a not, or what the model judges a disagreement), Answers (one of your open questions), Date (with Make a reminder) and Related, each naming the sentence in your other note, with Open and Not this. Nothing is written into your text; off by default and behind Settings, What the notebook learned, Margin reader (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I2; `POST /editor/read`, `ai/margin.py`, `tests/test_margin_reader_spec.py`). Measured with the model off, 500 notes, 12 requests on a sandbox at load 20: median 40 ms, p90 122 ms (the plan's budget is 300 ms); typing latency in Chromium not measured.
- Settings, Models, Test my models: the model bench runs your installed models on your own notes (filing, a cited answer from three notes, five tool calls each) and recommends one, with each model's numbers and the first things it got wrong, Stop, and Use this one; fully local, one run at a time, its last report kept (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I8, H3; `ai/bench.py`, `/models/bench`, `tests/test_bench_spec.py`). The offline harness's citation score now comes from `ai/bench.py`, so the two cannot drift. Not verified against a real model.
- Time travel: in Notes, Ask, the clock button answers from your notes as they were on a day you pick, and a note's History shows Then and now for an earlier version, what it said then against what it says today, sentence by sentence (row 23).
- Settings, What it learned: a "Learned from you" line counts your corrections and gives filing accuracy, the share of the notes Atlas filed that you left where it put them, older half of the last 200 against the newer half (row 20).
- From the original vision: a review queue (is:review in Notes, Accept the filing on a note's menu, and a Filings to check dashboard widget), Tidy suggestions in Manage categories (names alike in spelling or meaning to merge, categories empty for thirty days to remove, Not these remembered), a Filing style setting (by topic, by project or by time), charts in Ask for counting questions (how many notes per category this month) with their numbers and Save as PNG, a Most opened this month widget, and Explain this note on a note's menu (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 17).
- Reminders: Snooze 10 minutes on a reminder's menu, beside +1h and tomorrow on its row (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D8).
- Ctrl+Shift+V outside a text box saves what you copied as a new note, with Undo; a saved chat reopens where you left it; the AI status dot says how the last answer went (the model, its time, how much of its window it used); suggested links read as two note chips with a score bar, the reason behind Add a reason, and Link all above 70%; Settings, Account & security has Re-encrypt private notes. Settings, Packages: a package's name lines up with its Install button.
- Documents and reminders go to the recycle bin like notes: the Library's bin lists them, Restore brings back the same document with its history, attached notes and reminders (its Undo used to make a new copy), Delete for good, Empty the bin and the auto-clear take them too. The Notes selection bar's ⋯ has Move to space (each note keeps its category's name, its files and reminders go with it, and Undo sends each back) and Export as Markdown. Editing a note shows its words and reading time. Note templates fill {{clipboard}} and {{time}} and put the caret at {{cursor}} (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 5).
- Remind me on a document's and a board's or map's ⋯ menu, and on the Library's note card with Link to (a note picker); a document's Library card has Show in graph. A reminder now says what it is about (a note, a document, a board or a map), and its row opens that (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 1.3).
- Note types: Person, Project, Meeting, Book and Place come built in, each with its own colour and fields (deleted ones stay deleted), and the graph's View, Colour has Note type, which paints each note its type's colour (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D5).
- Whiteboard: View, Present frames shows a board's frames one at a time, full screen, in reading order, each fitted to the screen. The arrow keys, Space, Home and End (or the small bar at the foot) move through them, and Escape puts the board back as it was (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 16; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbpresent.js` 18/18 at 1440x900 and 390x844, light and dark).
- Whiteboard: lock. Ctrl+Shift+L (or Lock on an item's right-click menu) holds what is selected in place: clicks pass through it to the board, and Select all, a box selection, the eraser and a frame's drag leave it alone. Right-click the board and choose Unlock (it says how many are locked), or press Ctrl+Shift+L with nothing selected, to free them (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 15; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wblock.js` 17/17 at 1440x900 and 390x844, light and dark). A box selection drawn inside a frame no longer selects the frame as well.
- Whiteboard: frames. F (or Add in the rail, or Insert, Frame) places a titled region on a board; a click drops one, a drag draws it. Dragging its title moves everything inside it with it (Ctrl and drag moves the frame alone), double-click the title to rename it, and deleting it leaves what it held. Its inside lets clicks through, so you select and draw inside it as on the board; it exports with the board, and the board's AI read names each frame and the cards under it (WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 14; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbframes.js` 24/24 at 1440x900 and 4/4 at 390x844, light and dark).
- Mind maps: a topic can hold a note. "Add a note…" in the topic's menu opens a box beside it; the note is saved when you close it, and a mark on the topic opens it again. Markdown exports a note as a paragraph under its topic, OPML and FreeMind as `_note`, and all three read it back.
- Mind maps: View, Number the branches numbers every topic by its place in the outline (1, 1.1, 1.2), as quiet text before its name. It is saved with the map, and the Markdown and OPML exports keep the numbers and read them back.
- Whiteboard: a connector can carry a label ("yes", "no"). Select it and press Enter, or right-click it and choose Add a label; the label sits at the middle of the line, on the curve when it is bent, follows the line when either end moves, and exports with it. Double-click still bends the line.
- Mind maps: a connect drag says which connection it will make before you let go. The topic under the pointer gets a solid ring when the release will hang it in the tree, a dashed ring (and a dashed line) when it will be a cross-link, and a screen reader hears which.
- Mind maps: a topic can be a task. "Make this a task" in the topic's menu puts a box on it; press the box to tick it, and every topic above counts what is done under it ("1/2"). Markdown exports write tasks as `- [ ]` and `- [x]` and read them back; OPML and FreeMind keep them too.
- Whiteboard: a rectangle, ellipse, diamond or triangle holds text. Double-click it (or select it and press Enter), type, and press Enter; the text sits centred in the shape, wraps to it, and moves, resizes, undoes and exports with it. On a dark fill it turns white. The shape's right-click menu says Add text.
- Help covers every feature since 0.3.0 (INBOX 448 (1)): 17 new entries in the help the Guide, Chat and the popup agent read (Quick note, saving while the server is away, pictures and files in a note, how a note is filed and what its percentage means, suggested tags, the tag manager, Manage categories, a note's history, sorting notes, view addresses, Bookmarks, Contents, AI skills, Tesseract's language, dates and recent notes in answers, downloading a model, accessibility and zoom) and fourteen widened or corrected (mind map Ctrl+Shift+arrows, Enter and Shift+Enter, Ctrl+D and 100 undo steps; the notes filter's #tag, title:, before:, after:, in: and is:draft; source marks and Escape in Chat; Add to calendar; Background jobs' last-run lines; Draft with Atlas; hashtags; density Auto; the privacy receipt; deleting a space; locking puts dialogs away; the Settings groups; the Bookmarks sub-tab), 95 in all; of 52 features in `tests/test_help_coverage.py`, 4 reached their help from the question a person asks, now 52. Settings, Help lists all 95 in twelve groups from `GET /help/topics` instead of 13 hand-copied topics that still taught "g then a letter", and the Settings search finds a topic by its words ("percentage", "alt+n", "bookmarks"), settings first, a press opening the topic.
- Notes keep the tags filing suggested: each shows on the card as "+ tag", one press to add it, its × to stop suggesting it. With no AI they come from your own tags on the notes most like it.
- A note's card shows how sure the filing was (for example "83%") beside its category, and says whether Atlas or your notebook's words filed it.
- Notes: a category chip moves its note in one click (also Move to category in a note's menu); a tag chip shows that tag's notes; the filter box takes #tag, title:, before:, after:, in: and is:draft.
- Notes: Recently edited sort, a title field when editing, Copy [[link]] in a note's menu, and Home, End, Delete and F2 on a focused note.
- Notes sidebar: a Tags row opens every tag with its count; choose one to see its notes, or rename or remove it everywhere, with Undo.
- Category rename and merge can be undone, and deleting a category always offers to keep its notes in Uncategorised.
- Selected notes can be added to or removed from Favourites, archived, published (drafts) or have a tag removed, from the selection bar's ⋯, each undoable.
- Settings, Templates: Draft with Atlas writes a template from its name and one line, and pressing it again gives another version; nothing is saved until you add it.
- Graph: each category's notes gather in a place of their own, and notes with no links sit with their category rather than in a ring round the map (View, Group by category).
- A Library card, a board card and a Documents row are no longer a button holding buttons: the title is the control that opens them, so a screen reader reaches the tick and the menu as themselves. A click anywhere on the card still opens it.
- A Settings group's '?' is no longer inside the group's heading, so a screen reader reaches it as its own button; it is drawn where it was, and pressing it still opens a closed group.
- The Manage categories list no longer puts each row's menu button inside the row a screen reader selects: the rows are a grid, the menu is its own cell (Right reaches it, Left comes back), and every key and click works as before.
### Changed

- Boot budgets: the whiteboard rules only the Library bundle draws (30 KB of CSS) moved from the boot sheet into `library-lazy.css`, the status bar's slot list and its Settings rows into `settings-controls.js`, and the `openTour` guards and four documents.js globals folded away; boot CSS 183,375 to 179,885 gzipped, app scripts 320,436 to 319,757, guards 280 to 277, top-level lets 706 to 702. Measured identical on 3,400 drawn elements by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/cssdiff-lazy.js`.
- Documents and notes: while the line numbers show, the line the caret is on is lightly washed (the hover veil, readable in light and dark); with the numbers off nothing is highlighted (INBOX 651; activeline.js: wash 0.07 light and 0.09 dark, ink 14.9:1 and 10.7:1 over it).
- Editors: copy and cut with nothing selected take the whole line, as VS Code does; the clipboard gets the line with its newline, pasting that line puts it above the one you are on, and cutting the last line takes the newline before it (INBOX 652; linecopy.js, 7 checks in the documents editor and in the capture box).
- Chat, Ask, the popup agent and the Guide: the line under an answer in progress now says what is happening, in one set of words: Reaching Atlas while it waits for the first word, Reading your notes while it searches, Waking the model when a model is slow to load, Atlas is thinking, Atlas is writing, and Atlas is followed by the tool's action when it uses one (a persona's name replaces Atlas); with progress indicators set to Still it is the same words as a single pulsing line (INBOX 649; phases.js: 7 stages, motion on and off).
- Notes: the "Write with Atlas" sub-tab is now the Writing room, a name that still fits with no AI model set up; its Settings, Models row, the help, the Guide and the tour say the same, and asking the Guide about "write with atlas" still finds it (INBOX 648).
- Tour: between 641 and 819px wide the Settings steps now point at the section picker instead of three strip buttons that are hidden there, so the count matches the cards shown; walked at 600 to 1100 and on an empty notebook.
- Gate: scripts/gate.sh --sweeps no longer names fifteen sweeps whose files were deleted (each could only fail); a test keeps the list and the folder in step.
- Sweeps: lib.js gains openBoardsTab and waitForBoardOpen (the Boards sub-tab picked and the board code waited for, not a Library press and a sleep); seven board sweeps use them, two of which used to time out.
- Sweeps: bm1005-sidebar.js measures the whiteboard rail's Notes tab skeletons (5 at 300ms, 264 notes after) as well as the Library's; both were already built.
- OCR workspace on a phone: the page-size track (Fit, 100%) grows round its 44px buttons instead of leaving them 12px past a 32px track; wbtopbar.js seeds a scanned image and measures the head at 1440 and 390.
- Sweeps: phonechrome.js asserts, at any WIDTH and HEIGHT, that every tab's page ends where the status bar (or the phone tab dock) begins; measured at nine widths from 600 to 1093, nothing overlaps.
- Timeline on a phone: the calendar strip's spacing steps down a token so the list begins at 336px of 844, inside the first-screen rule; phonechrome.js probes the status bar with the three things the phone bar shows (a job, offline, power saver) and asserts the agent's activity leaves it folded away.
- Graph: the map's sizes (how central each note is) are worked out from the links' plain columns rather than by loading every link in full, so the first open of the map after a change at 5,000 notes went from about 1.2 s to about 0.7 s (GRAPH_PLAN).
- Graph: the first open of the map after a change is faster at notebook scale; the map's data was being passed through a generic converter that walked every value only to hand it back unchanged. At 5,000 notes the first build after a write went from about 1.5 s to about 1.2 s, and the next one from about 0.7 to 0.5 s (GRAPH_PLAN).
- Mind maps: a topic's menu (and the command palette) has Summarise this branch. A few sentences about everything under the topic go into its note, open for you to read, change or keep; with no model running the branch is said plainly from its own topics, and says so.
- Mind maps: Alt+1 to Alt+9 show that many levels of the whole map, folding everything deeper (Alt+1 leaves the trunks alone), so a large map reads as its outline in one press and opens a level at a time. Also in the command palette, the topic menu and the keys sheet; one Undo puts it back.
- Boards: the sidebar's Library shows loading placeholders the first time it opens instead of an empty panel while its shapes and templates arrive, and the Notes tab does the same before your notes have loaded (INBOX 596).
- Chat: the row of buttons that shows when you point at a message (copy, edit, delete) now hangs over its own message's bottom edge instead of below it, so at narrower windows it no longer lies over the start of the answer under a question (7 to 13px across it from 640 to 820px wide, now clear by 1px).
- Graph: the map reads a slimmer payload. A note's fields at their usual value (no pin, no type, no parent, not pinned, no file, no tags) and an unexplained link's empty reason are left out and filled back in the page, times are to the second: at 5,000 notes the map's read went from 3,145 KB to 1,767 KB, and a rebuild after the first one from about 1.0 to 1.5 s to about 0.7 s. The dashboard reads the same slim payload, so one build after a change serves both (GRAPH_PLAN, a slimmer node).
- Development: the badge alignment sweep measures an icon against its words' cap-height centre, the label recipe's one target (DESIGN.md), not the x-height band it used before, which read correctly aligned chips 1.5px high; the older status bar ink sweep it replaced is retired (INBOX 503, 592).
- Boards and maps: the tools docked at the side are one column of one width on a board and a map (176px; 173 and 225 before, where the map's layout picker set it), every row four cells in the same four columns so the tools line up like a palette, the layout picker a row of its own; on a phone the tools are always the bottom strip, so the open sidebar no longer covers the tool picker, and the switch to dock at the side is not shown there (INBOX 596).
- Atlas: the tail never holds still while idle. Each behaviour it takes up varies its swing, speed and curl a little, a small ripple swings it nearly as one on a clock of its own, and it draws out and back along its length a few percent, so its tip goes round a small loop the other waves cannot cancel; a slow frame no longer slows it. Measured stepped at 60 frames a second over 60 seconds, the tip's longest spell within 0.75px went from 1,100ms to 400ms (masculine) and 650 to 150ms (feminine); in real time at 8 to 11 frames a second, 588 and 474ms (INBOX 601).
- The dashboard's widgets appear together once they have drawn, on every visit, instead of moving about for a second as each one filled in (a layout shift of 0.26 on a notebook of 300 notes); the opening waits for them too, 1.2 seconds at most. Stylesheet rules for ten classes nothing in the app uses any more (an old Library activity view and stat row, a whiteboard sidebar, the reminders' old list bar, the graph's old toolbar groups, two background-art drifts) are gone, which keeps the boot stylesheets under their budget (INBOX 577, 580).
- Code layout: the frontend's scripts live in `frontend/js/` (50 files, beside `css/` and `vendor/`), not loose in `frontend/`. `sw.js` stays at the frontend root, because a service worker only controls pages under its own path. Nothing about the app changes; the script URLs are `/js/<name>.js`, a test checks that every script path in `index.html`, the lazy loader and the workers resolves to a real file.
### Changed

- Models: Suggested downloads are cards grouped by purpose (chat and filing, bigger machines, search, images, reading text). Each says its size on disk, the memory it asks for, what it is good at and whether it fits this computer; one starting pick per group; Download, Use for chat and the like as the one action, Remove and Copy name in a menu, and progress with Cancel on the card. Download another model takes an Ollama name or a Hugging Face link and says what it is before it downloads. A switch hides the ones too big for this computer.
- Settings: searching a word lists the settings that match (the setting's own words, the section and group it is in) and a press opens it and rings it; a long section has a sticky index of its groups with the one you are at marked; choosing a section from the keyboard puts the focus on its heading, and the arrow keys still walk the list. The Models group heads are shortened to their names, with the detail in one line beneath.
- Settings: the sections sit in six groups (AI, Notebook, Look and feel, Privacy and security, System, Help and About). Search and index is its own section, holding the search engine and the search index from Models and Search relevance from General; the answer style moved from General to Personas. A link that names a setting opens the section that holds it now.
- The masculine Atlas's lower body is one thick wisp curving in an S from the full width of his hips to a soft curled tip, with two smaller wisps branching off it at different heights, all one smooth shape with no seams, in place of five straight spikes.
- Files attached to a note are one card everywhere (the note, its edit form, Capture, a document, the graph and the timeline): the picture or a tinted kind icon, the whole name on up to two lines, and the kind, size and date. Click the card to open the file; its ⋯ menu has Open, Download, Rename, Describe with AI, Edit description, Annotate a copy, Copy as a link and Remove. Removing a file from a note's text can be undone, and its upload is only deleted once nothing else uses it.
- One "working" mark across the app: the same ring, 1.15 times the text beside it, 2px stroke, turning once every 0.9s in the accent's text colour, on a note's "Atlas is reading…" and "Filing…", the agent palette and its steps, the activity panel, the tension review, a long job's toast, the Library's readings and every button that waits (which now also says so with the ring and cannot be pressed twice). Before, the same state was a ring, a spinning icon at two speeds, a pulsing word that never moved, the chat's reply dots, or a still icon. With reduced motion the ring breathes instead of turning, and "…" is always the one-character ellipsis.
### Added

- A double-click on Notes or Library in the top bar goes back to its first sub-tab (INBOX 659).
- A category's colour can be chosen: in Manage categories (and a category's ⋯ menu in the sidebar), Colour opens twelve swatches that each read as a dot in light and dark, plus Automatic to go back to the name-based colour. The choice shows at once on the category's dots and chips, its graph nodes and legend, the timeline and the dashboard, and is kept with the category through a rename.
- Speed: the reference chips on the note cards (asked for at every unlock) are read for a whole page of notes at once instead of four database queries per note, so sixty cards cost 6 statements rather than 242 and about a third of the time on 500 notes (172 to 53 ms), and 5.8 times less on 5,000 notes (2,267 to 388 ms, same machine and load); what they count is unchanged.
- Speed: the dashboard's activity strip and heatmap read each recent note's day as a column instead of loading every note whole, text included; on 5,000 notes made within the year the heatmap went from 179 to 24 ms and the stats from 184 to 55 ms (same machine, interleaved runs).
- Speed: the Library's Files & Images list (and the pickers that offer your uploads) works out where each file is used by asking the database for the notes, documents and board objects that mention `/media/` instead of loading every one; on 5,000 notes 140 ms became 9 ms (same machine, interleaved runs), with the same answers.
- Speed: the first click of a session (the unlock) no longer waits for the reminder chime's audio device to open; it is made just after, when the browser is idle. The click's handlers went from 44 to 56 ms (the longest script on the lock screen) to under 1 ms in headless Chromium, and the chime still works (the context is running afterwards).
- Speed: the foreign keys a note is looked up by now have indexes (a note's replies, the boards it is on and a board's cards and sketches, its reminders and bookmarks), added to existing notebooks at startup like the others. 900 lookups by them took 604 ms unindexed and 2.9 ms indexed on 5,000 notes with 4,000 board cards and 1,500 reminders; opening a note's connections or deleting one is within noise at that size, so this matters for big boards rather than ordinary use.
### Fixed

- Filing with no model: a note whose own category wins its words' vote by a clear lead (twice the next) is filed there, even when a shared word like "oil" splits the vote; before, an obvious cooking note stayed Uncategorised. Measured on the leave-one-out set: 17% filed (was 15%), 71% of those right (was 67%).
- Phone header: at 360 wide with Text size Large and Density Spacious the shell was 368px wide and every tab scrolled sideways by 8px; the header's targets stay 44px in Large text and below 360 its padding and gaps step down, so the page no longer scrolls sideways at 320, 360 and 390 in any text size or density.
- Phone action sheets (a ⋯ at 390) leave with the same short fade the menus have on Escape, on a press outside and on a row, instead of vanishing in one frame; nothing animates when Interface animations is set to reduced.
- Mind maps: a topic's resize grip, link and reference doors now use the topic as it is now; after the map had refreshed, a plain drag of the grip put a cleared text size back and saved the older copy of the topic.
- Mind maps: the left rail shows This map and Outline however the map was opened; from the board picker or straight after New board it kept a whiteboard's Notes, Layers and Pages, which only went back to Library (INBOX 657).
- Mind maps: dragging a line's curve is undone by Ctrl+Z; the undo step used to hold the new curve (INBOX 658).
- Timeline: the table's header row and the feed's date headers are opaque again when the list scrolls under them; their base layer had never painted, so rows showed through the labels (INBOX 655).
- Agent activity no longer opens over the page at every launch for the app's own start-up work (loading the search model, rebuilding the index, starting the local search engine, image captions and page reads) or for downloads started in Settings; they stay listed under the status bar's activity item, and a failure is still announced (INBOX 653).
- Whiteboard: turning a card, a box or a selection now carries the links touching it round with it as it turns; before, a link stayed on the unturned box until the item was next moved (INBOX 647).
- Boards and maps: dragging a selection box, an item or a branch to the edge of the canvas pans the board to follow, faster the deeper into the edge, and the item stays under the pointer (INBOX 608).
- Graph: Mind map on the selection bar builds the map from the notes' links: the picked or most connected note in the middle, linked notes under the note they link to, the rest grouped by category, no topic left with more than eight children, and every other link kept as a cross-link, laid out on both sides. Its notice and its bell row have Open (INBOX 607).
- Boards and maps: the board's sidebar. With the tools docked at the side it stands beside them instead of over them, and is the same height on a board and a map; the Library's ⋯ menu hangs from its button's right edge; a map's rail has This map (what the map is made of, its look, Open every folded branch, Lay the map out again) and the Outline in place of Notes, Layers and Pages; and the Library starts with Templates, five for a board (Kanban with cards, a retrospective, a flowchart loop, meeting notes, a week plan) and seven for a map (Brainstorm, Decision, Project, Cause and effect, Pros and cons, Book notes, Meeting), placed by a click or dragged to where they go, a map's under the topic they are dropped on (INBOX 596).
- Mind maps: several topics picked at once (a box dragged round them, or Shift-click) are a map selection, not a board one. No group box with resize and rotate grips; the bar has colour, bold, tasks, fold and summarise for all of them, each one undo step; the right-click menu has the same in words (INBOX 617).
- Mind maps: a selected topic's bar has the text size on it (S, M, L, XL, one press), and every choice in its Text, Shape and Branch line panels is a row of buttons rather than a list inside a menu, so nothing takes more than two presses. The two small grips above a topic's corner are one square on its bottom right corner that resizes it like a card; Shift while dragging scales its text with it (INBOX 610).
- Mind maps: a long branch is a smooth curve at every zoom; its two sides are drawn as a spline through more samples instead of straight pieces that showed their corners (INBOX 609).
- Improve writing: Start and Use the suggestion are 44px under touch like every other dialog foot (they were held at 32 by their own height rule; `improvefoot.js`, 0 findings at 390 and 1440, light and dark). The background art's unused CSS-style rules (the mesh and bubbles, canvas styles since) are gone, 370 bytes of boot CSS.
- Help audit (2026-10-05): the Guide, the help popovers, the README and a few messages named places the UI had renamed, and now say what the UI says. Settings, Shortcuts is Keyboard shortcuts, Settings, Tools is Tools it can use, Settings, Extras is Packages, the model bench switch is under What it learned, the search engine is under Search and index in the README, and Account & security is spelled as the nav spells it; the Library's sub-tab is Boards & maps (the Guide said Whiteboards and Boards and maps), Files & Images is two sub-tabs, Images and Files, and Write with Atlas has Split into notes where the Guide named an Extract notes button and a Writing Room sub-tab the Notes tab does not have. The autonomous background AI entry's badge opened Profile and now opens Background tasks. tests/test_help_settings_paths.py pins every "Settings, A, B" path in the Guide, the README and the app's own messages to the nav and panes in index.html, so a rename fails the build; scratchpad/ui-sweeps/helpaudit.js opens all 21 panes and 80 paths in a browser.
- Graph: the map stays framed when a panel opens or closes beside it (INBOX 613).
- Appearance: the generative background stays off when it is switched off; the power saver, a theme change or the tour could draw it anyway (INBOX 611).
- Ask: a sentence drawn from a picture's caption gets its note's number, so a note that is one word and a sketch is cited too (INBOX 604).
- Notes: the Ask sub-tab is as wide as a tab should be (INBOX 605); Customise can reset the Quick access highlights alone (INBOX 603).
- Start-up: a session left over from before the app restarted goes straight to the lock screen, instead of drawing the dashboard with every widget failing first (INBOX 597).
- Ask: the model is shown each note's tags and attached files (with their captions), so a note that is one word and a sketch is no longer passed over as too vague (INBOX 594).
- Ask: the last answer's "Only 2 of 6 sentences" notice goes when you ask again, rather than sitting over the next answer's thinking (INBOX 593).
- Graph: tree, radial and arc no longer throw when a reply is listed before the note it answers, so switching layout works again (INBOX 579); a reply loop hangs off its category instead of hanging the layout.
- Chat: the agent's step circles sit exactly on the rail's line (INBOX 588).
- Documents: printing a document, or saving it as PDF, gave one blank page; the print rule hid the part of the window the document page now sits in. A long document prints on as many pages as it needs again.
- Documents: at 1024 wide the sidebar's Outline tab no longer runs under the collapse button; a narrow sidebar puts its two tabs on their own row under it.
- Exports: the writing dictionary's Export saves in the desktop window too (it used a browser-only download that the desktop window ignores); every download goes through one helper.
- Chat: a document imported through the paperclip lands in the space that is open, not the default space. Every upload that sets its own headers (the chat, the Library, documents, the whiteboard, media, Settings) now sends the space with the token through one helper, and a lint fails on a header object that drops it.
- Graph: a note's size in focus mode and the Local map is the whole map's (its PageRank), whichever view was opened first; before, the two shared one cached ranking of two different graphs (drafts and boards in one, not the other), so sizes depended on the order, and turning Maps on kept the ranking without boards. The graph also loads about four times faster when warm at 5,000 notes (3.3 to 4.1 s down to 0.7 to 1.0 s in process), reading columns rather than whole notes (GRAPH_PLAN, decision 2026-10-05).
- The chat list's sort select is as wide as its words (144px) rather than the whole sidebar column (266px).

## [0.3.32] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- A saved bookmark can be linked into any note or document from the "/" menu (Bookmark link), and each reference in a document's References panel has Insert as a link, which writes `[title](url)` where the caret is.

### Fixed

- A note's History says who filed it and how sure: "filed under Gym by granite4.1:3b, 82% sure", or "by meaning (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)". A change made by an AI tool names the model that made it, "Atlas (gemma-4-E4B): add tags", beside your own edits.
- A note the model had not answered for when the app closed is asked about again on the next launch; its by-meaning stand-in is replaced unless you moved it.
- Past the wait, a note is no longer held on "Filing…" while the embedding model loads: it waits in Uncategorised for the model's answer instead.
- Stopping filing no longer marks the note as filed by you, so re-evaluate can still file it later.
- The note edit form: a related note and its Link button are one height, and Preview replaces the whole writing area, line numbers included, instead of squeezing them; the line-number column never shrinks.
- The graph's fit no longer leaves a wide empty band along one edge: the layout kept moving after it was framed, so it is framed once more when it comes to rest, unless you have zoomed or panned.
- Fewer graph labels: a map of more than 20 notes names its best-connected third at the fitted zoom; zooming in, hovering or searching names the rest.

## [0.3.31] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Deleting a space asks what happens to its contents: delete everything in it, or move everything to another space (a category both spaces have is merged). The dialog used to promise the notes moved to Default while the space's contents were deleted.
- Filing can be stopped by hand: the "Filing…" chip on a note has File by meaning now, Leave it where it is, and File it myself; the filing rows in Settings, Background tasks and the activity popup have Stop, which files every waiting note by meaning. A stopped note is yours, so a late model answer never moves it. Quitting the app does not stop filing.
- Switching the search engine back to the built-in model works: Apply & re-index was disabled whenever Built-in was picked, so the Ollama model stayed in use and could not be removed. The built-in option now names its own model and says when it is the one in use.
- The one-time automatic install of sentence-transformers for the built-in search model is shown in Settings, Models, with nomic-embed-text from Ollama offered as the alternative; README and INSTALL say it happens on first launch.
- Deleting a space no longer fails with "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed": every table that points at the space's notes (their scores and derived facts were missed) is cleared first, found from the database schema rather than a hand-kept list.
- A new note no longer looks like it is filing forever. The page kept checking for only 26 seconds and never refreshed the card after that; it now watches until the note settles, and the line under the composer says where it went. A note left filing when the app closed is filed on the next launch.
- Filing takes seconds, not minutes, without giving up accuracy: the model is asked with thinking off and a short reply; past the wait (15 seconds, adjustable in Settings, Automation, 5 to 60, with a reset) the note is filed by meaning at once, and the model's answer replaces that when it arrives, unless you moved the note yourself. The filing model is warmed up at launch. The card settles as soon as the category is known, before the note's search vector is built.
- Re-evaluate, adding context, the agent's own notes and extraction keep their long wait, so a slow model is never swapped for a weaker guess there.
- Every filing failure is in Settings, Logs (a model that errors or answers something unusable used to be silent), and Settings, Background tasks shows a model answering past the wait and the filing model warming up.
- The README no longer points to the MSI installer, which is not built at the moment.
- Improve writing starts when you press Start, not as soon as it opens or a mode is picked; its two buttons share a height and the chosen mode has round corners.
- The Windows installer's optional packages page lays each row out by its measured height, so the text no longer overlaps at 125% display scaling.
- The packaged Windows app no longer shows a blank window titled "tk" at launch: the bootloader splash (a Tcl/Tk window that failed to draw) is off, and the app's own loading window shows the launch.

### Changed
- A sleeping companion stays asleep: a click near it is only a twitch, a tab switch or a move carries it asleep and it arrives lying or curled, and the app's news no longer pulls it upright. Poked, it wakes over a few seconds with a yawn and stays up; poked again while still waking it pouts, and a third time it is grumpy for half a minute before coming down through a pout.
- The companion does something sudden or large (a wave, a hop, a cheer, a wander) at most once a minute or so, and never while you type or scroll.
- A face the companion puts on for an act eases back over a couple of seconds instead of cutting back.
- The companion only rests on the top edges of panels, never on a row inside a card or hanging under one, checks each place it would take for words under it, takes a smaller size to fit a small clean place, and otherwise tucks behind the bottom bar with only its eyes showing.
- On a tab switch the companion goes with its tab in the same frame and always follows you to the new tab (it could stay away after a switch from a scrolled page); a place it was resting on that goes away is replaced at once rather than after seconds.
- Atlas as the companion leans with its own body, holds its arms a different way at each new place, and lies down on its nebula or curls up in it, and back, through its own poses.
- Appearance > Companion movement says what Always animate is overriding, when it is.

- Companions can be saved like looks: Appearance > Saved companions keeps who it is, its look, size, what it does and how it moves under a name, to apply, rename or delete.
- When the companion is you or your own character and you have not made that face yet, Appearance says it is read from a name and offers Create your avatar; the companion's menu offers it too, and choosing Your own character there opens its maker instead of quietly making one up.
- Faces in the persona rows and on your profile stay inside their circle, as the dashboard emblem's does.
- The avatar lab keeps the mood and pose you pick (a Live behaviour switch lets Atlas's own moods play), and neither the lab nor the companion wears a night cap standing up.
- The companion no longer perches over words: a phrase with a background inside a paragraph is not a ledge, and a perch with any words under it is chosen only when nothing clean is left.
- The companion keeps walking, climbing and materialising in when Performance mode turns itself on (it only fades now when you or your system ask for less motion). Appearance > Companion movement can follow the app, always animate or fade only, and says why it is fading; About shows the companion's motion and its reason.
- The companion no longer rocks from side to side as the pointer passes: its lean follows a smoothed gaze, holds a side at least 1.3 seconds and ignores a flick.
- Every modal and popup head that closed with a plain "Close" word, or sized its own icon buttons separately, now shares DESIGN.md's dialog-head recipe (the Documents AI assistant panel, which the owner named as the one to match): title, its '?' beside it, then icon-only actions with Close last, `.dialog-head`/`.dialog-head-actions`/`.dialog-head-btn`, one shared definition, no surface fork. Rolled out to Notifications, Earlier versions, Connections, the bin, Keyboard shortcuts, Tools & features, Meeting notes, Improve writing and Quick sketch, alongside the assistant panel itself: ten heads, each button 32px on desktop and 44px under touch or a coarse pointer (its own token, not the app-wide `--target-min` floor, which stays untouched), a visible `:focus-visible` ring, and icon contrast measured at 5.9:1 (light) and 8.0:1 (dark) against the panel behind it.
- The default buttons are quiet rather than silver: a near-white face with a breath of the accent behind a hairline edge (3:1 against its ground), a slightly bolder label and an accent icon, so a button no longer looks like the field beside it; grey only under the pointer; an icon button standing alone (a note's pin and menu, a dialog's close) is a bare glyph until hovered; standing buttons and menu openers are at least 32px tall; dropdowns draw a thin chevron; Reminders' nudges are two steppers, "- 15 min +" and "- 1 day +", that the arrow keys drive too; Settings' section rows keep their chevron inside the highlight with room before the title; and the new-reminder form no longer overflows its sheet.
- The feminine Atlas wears an astral crown instead of a parted fringe: her hair sweeps back off the brow in fine strands from a softly lit hairline, with star dust at the roots and a circlet of tiny stars.
- Atlas's lower body blends into the torso with no line at the waist, and the masculine look's wisps fall as three broad, straight streams that sway heavier and slower.
- Atlas moves by its own look: it glides rather than hops when it walks (his streams trailing behind him), she sways on her own slower clock, floats with her arm drifting down, and waves beside her head; its skirt now swings when it walks or is carried, and its own wave and scratch play.
- A sleeping Atlas keeps its arms off the orbit rings, is no longer startled by every click or a held Ctrl, wakes slowly when poked and dozes off slowly, and lies on a soft nebula pillow.
- Atlas's bell and lantern hang from its hand in both looks; a head scratch reaches the head; the feminine arms read at the companion's size.
- Manage categories lines up: the title, help and close on one line, the filter (now with a search icon and a clear) and New category at one height, one focus ring; Split's Ask shows it is working and answers in one short line.
- The Manage categories panel is redesigned: the same head as the documents AI panel, a filter beside New category, quiet rows with a count pill and a menu that shows on hover, a keyboard-walkable list where Space selects, and a footer to merge or delete several categories at once.
- A category's split can be suggested by Atlas (the utility model reads the notes and proposes named groups to review), with the tag-based suggestion kept for when the model is off.
- Atlas's hair now starts on the head: a short swept cap (masculine) or a soft parted cap (feminine) covers the crown down to a soft hairline, so the hair grows from the scalp instead of rising behind a bald dome.
- A generated companion rests its hands on its hips when cool, clasps them when bashful and holds them to its chest when worried.
- Sitting, the companion lets clicks through its legs and anything drawn below its seat, so a small button under it (the dashboard's Full) still works.
- Asleep, the companion lies down on its pillow when there is room and dozes where it is when there is not, and it moves by its look: a masculine companion walks and floats slower with heavier steps, a feminine one quicker and lighter with a sway (Atlas by its own look, a face drawn from a name by Face look).
- The companion never does a thing exactly the same way twice running: a wave may be one hand, both or with a hop, a hop may be a skip or a spin, a nap curled or tipped over, a glad moment a bounce, a sway or a spin, and each play runs a little faster or slower.
- The companion can be rested on a button: dropped on a Start something tile or a toolbar button at least as wide as it, it stands there, and the button still takes its click under its feet. A wide control nearby (the dashboard's find field) no longer throws it off a place you chose.
- A generated companion's arms rest in its mood (open when happy, up when surprised, a hand to its chin, its head, an eye or its mouth when thinking, confused, sleepy or worried), easing from one to the next, and an act such as a wave hands them back to the mood's pose.
- The companion's gaze reaches as far for every kind (further for a Large one), follows a little wider, and drifts back to looking ahead when you move away rather than snapping. The larger faces (the enlarged view, your Profile face, persona cards) now glance, blink, hop and, enlarged, wave now and then, and blink when the pointer comes onto them, from one shared timer that runs only while such a face is on screen; the enlarged view says what a face is and how to say hello rather than "A face of its own".
- Atlas's hair now starts on the head: a short swept cap (masculine) or a soft parted cap (feminine) covers the crown down to a soft hairline, so the hair grows from the scalp instead of rising behind a bald dome.
- The masculine Atlas reads as a star-being rather than a stiff mascot: his torso tapers from natural shoulders into a trail of nebula wisps instead of two pillar legs, his arms are slimmer with a soft bend and small relaxed hands, his eyes are softer, and he sways gently at rest.
- Categories can be managed by hand: a Manage categories panel (from the Categories head in the notes sidebar, each category's menu, and Settings) renames, merges, splits (pick the notes, or review a split suggested from their tags) and deletes categories, asking where the notes go; notes move by ticking them and choosing Move to, or by dragging a note's category label onto another category. Every change can be undone.
- Atlas can lie down to sleep on its own nebula stream, which gathers under it as a bed: sprawled with an arm behind his head (masculine) or curled on her side with her hands under her cheek (feminine), either way round, through in-between frames from sitting, and can also curl up where it sits.
- Atlas's arms match its mood, differently for each look and in up to three variations: open or raised when happy, a hand to the mouth when laughing, at the chin or folded when thinking, up when surprised, scratching its head when confused, rubbing an eye when sleepy, hanging when sad, on the hips when proud, clasped when shy or worried, and to the chest in love.
- Atlas can lean to the left or right while still facing forward: the body turns a few degrees about the feet, the head follows a little further with the face turning that way, and the tail and the nebula catch up a beat later and settle, all eased over about a third of a second.
- A drowsy Atlas looks sleepy rather than creepy: the lids droop in soft curves over small pupils that look down, the brows and mouth relax, and blinks are slow and linger closed.
- The companion takes what you do gradually: the pointer on it gets a look, a blink and a brighter face at once, or, asleep, a stir and then a wake if you stay; a click on a sleeping companion wakes it slowly (a yawn, a stretch, a look at you) unless the clicks come fast, and it stays awake at least 45 seconds; clicks while awake go from pleased to playful to grumpy, each face coming down gradually. How you have treated it lately (its warmth, relaxing over minutes) leans what it does next. Bored of one spot, it now and then takes a few steps over or wanders to a nearby perch and comes back, never while you type or read near it. Pressing it no longer stops what it is doing unless the press becomes a drag (a click on it asleep used to be answered as if it were awake).
- The companion's faces crossfade instead of swapping, and a big reaction comes down through a smaller one before its own face returns; asleep it trails three drifting z's and wears a night cap, and a confused, happy or nervous moment brings a small "?", sparkle or sweat drop. Both can be switched off in What it does on its own.
- The companion leans its body a few degrees toward what it looks at, the way it is about to go, and now and then at rest, still facing you, eased in and out.
- Close by, the companion keeps its eyes and head on your pointer as it moves (Atlas's irises too), and a pointer held near a sleeping companion wakes it gently: groggy, a stretch, then a look your way. Faces follow the pointer in Appearance still turns this off.
- The companion has things of its own now: it lies down for a nap on a pillow, reads a book, sinks into a beanbag, pulls up a chair, face palms and shrugs, each easing in with its prop first and out with the body getting up first. Appearance > Companion > What it does on its own has a switch for each of its doings, old and new, and the long restful ones are paced like rest, so they cost nothing while it sits.
- The companion goes everywhere by the way its body moves: a small shift is a hop, a nearer place a walk at a walking pace, a far one a poof, and Atlas and the winged or ghostly faces float there; its panel moving under it or the window resizing is travelled the same way, never slid. Hanging from the top bar, it now also peeks down from under the bar head first, the rest of it hidden behind the bar.
- The companion comes in cleanly: it is never drawn before it has a place (at start it used to show on a card's corner and then jump 140 to 235px as the page filled in), it waits for the page to stop moving under its perch before it enters, a panel that jumps is glided after rather than jumped with, leaving with its tab is a short fade rather than a cut, coming down or up out of a bar is revealed from behind the bar, and its poof out and in is two eased gestures with a small overshoot. In its enlarged view the drawing's real reach (Atlas's tail, a hat) is kept clear of the name, which it overlapped by 4 to 16px, and Atlas is captioned as the app's own guide rather than "Calm face with shades".
- Atlas's feminine silhouette reads as one body: the arms grow out of the shoulders with no seam, and the hair grows from the head, darker at the roots, with no gap or hard edge beside the wings.
- Two of Atlas's moods read as something else and are redrawn: happy (it looked calm) now smiles with its eyes, and determined (it looked bored) looks focused rather than half asleep.
- Atlas dozes restfully in both looks: soft closed eyes with light lashes, a relaxed mouth instead of a pursed "o", less blush, three Zs that drift up and fade on a slow loop (still under Reduce motion), and a starry night cap that fades in while dozing or napping.
- Atlas's feminine chest is drawn with light instead of lines: a smooth curve in the outline and soft glows and shading blended into the body, where two drawn arcs read as a bikini top.
- Editing the same note or document in two windows no longer loses one of them: a save made over text that was changed elsewhere is refused, and the editor asks whether to keep your version, take the other one, or compare the two first.
- The avatar lab and companion simulator are tidier: the lab's actions sit in an even grid, specimens stand on one ground line so sizes compare by height, pose cards leave headroom for the taller nebula, and the status reads as a pill; the simulator's bar wraps whole buttons instead of splitting labels, with a steady-width position readout.
- Atlas's feminine figure has a very slightly fuller chest: half a unit of swell at the flanks and two faint arcs of shade, nothing more.
- Atlas moves with secondary motion: the tail and the nebula each take a second, slower sway out of step with the first, so their flow never repeats, and in the large drawings the hair sways about its roots; all of it on the compositor (0 layouts a second measured at rest) and still under Reduce motion.
- Atlas's feminine ears are small feathered wings with a soft glow, where thin fins read as horns, and her icon (16 to 28px) wears her hair: a lilac silhouette behind the head and a fringe over the crown, so it reads as her rather than a pale blob with two points.
- Atlas's nebula stream goes round the whole figure, both looks: one orbit from under the feet, up the left side, behind the body, out over the hair and across above the crown, so the mane and the rings no longer hide its upper half. The near half is drawn over the hair and rings, wider and brighter, the far half under the figure and quieter, and the ribbon turns edge-on where they meet; both drift together and hold still under Reduce motion.
- The companion lives on the tab it is on: switching away hides it with that tab, coming straight back shows it where it was, and it only follows after you have stayed on a new tab for about two seconds, walking on from the nearest edge, climbing down from the top bar or up over the bottom bar, or gathering out of starlight, never popping in. Hiding it dissolves it.
- Atlas, from the owner's close-ups: shaped hands (a thumb, two fingers with a split, tapered from the wrist) and feet with a heel, an arch and a toe; the outline glow half as wide; the feminine hair grows out of the scalp and the torso fades into the skirt instead of sitting on it like an egg; her middle wisps are fuller and reach lower; the nebula is wider round both looks.
- The Guide covers the whole app: new help for the corner companion, Atlas's look, the generated faces, every Settings section and the app's layout (76 entries, was 59; 22 new questions all answered first-time right, the old 177 unchanged at 176). Each answer can switch between Atlas's words and the app's own help, laid out with a heading, where it lives, the steps and a button that opens the setting's own row.
- The companion moves like a body: it crouches before it sets off, springs up, squashes into the landing and rebounds once; its limbs ease into a new pose instead of snapping; and it is quieter at rest (the rings' shimmer half as deep and slow, a smaller, slower tail swish and wag, a shallower float).
- The companion perches on the page's own panels first on every tab (a card, a toolbar, the underside of a panel) and rides them as they scroll, where every tab used to leave it on a window bar; it skips menus that are faded out and fields you type into, and Atlas's tail counts as part of what may not cover a control.
- Generated faces wear a mood each in their own way: per mood, each character favours its own eyes, brows and mouth from a few near neighbours (one happy face grins with sparkling eyes, another smiles a cat's smile), always the same for the same name, colours unchanged.
- Atlas reads as one figure rather than parts: the masculine legs root deep in the body with a calf and a slim ankle, smaller soft feet, fuller shoulders with a forearm's swell and a smaller mitten; the body and limbs share one shade, the torso's glow no longer outlines its hem over the legs, and the nebula's new tip fades in from nothing.
- Atlas's rings tilt a little further and the planets on them slowly go round, on the compositor (no layout, no repaint), fading as they pass behind the head; the nebula stream now rises from above the crown.

### Added

- Mind map topics can be filled with their colour: the topic strip's Shape
  menu has a Fill row with "Fill this topic", "Fill with its branch" (the
  topic and everything under it, including topics added later) and, inside a
  filled branch, "No fill" for one topic. Stored as the node's `fill` style
  field, so it survives a reload, round-trips through OPML and FreeMind, and
  "Back to the branch" clears it. A tint of the topic's colour
  (`--wb-fill-strength`, 24% light, 32% dark), so the label keeps its normal
  ink: measured at 11.3:1 light and 9.6:1 dark on the palette's blue, and
  4.86:1 at the worst case, a white topic in dark theme.
- Back and Forward return to a Settings section at the scroll position you left it.
- The template picker has a Manage templates button that opens Settings, Templates.
- The companion's menu has "Tuck behind the bar": it sits behind the status bar with its head showing until you click or drag it; its glow fades while it hides. Graph node sizes scale to the graph's busiest note.
- The companion's far moves vary: a zip, a walk or, much further, a poof; its small steps are a hop, a shuffle or a scoot.
- The README has a "Meet Atlas" section with its own portrait, every screenshot retaken, eight main features shown a second time in the dark theme beside a light/dark split, and a richer showcase notebook (clusters, hubs and loose notes, both AI-reasoned and plain links) behind the graph shot.
- A word rotates beside the thinking dots in chat, capture Ask and the popup agent ("Pondering", "Leafing through your notes"), in the answering persona's own voice; Atlas gets a starlit set of its own, and every persona can write, or ask the AI to suggest, its own list in Settings, Personas. A new "Show thinking words" switch in Settings, Appearance turns it off.
- The LAN switch offers a "Restart now" action when a restart is actually needed to take effect, on either direction of the switch, instead of only saying so in text.
- The popup agent's reply rows wear the persona's own avatar circle, the same as Chat's own bubbles.
- A mind map topic's colour is reachable from words too: right-click it, More, Topic colour (or Branch colour past the first trunk); the canvas's own background colour picker in the View menu is now named "Canvas background colour" and says PNG/SVG export keeps it, and the mind map's own "Where the map's controls live" help mentions both.
- Leaving a note edit form, the Capture box or a document mid-autosave with unsaved changes now asks before an in-app tab switch discards it (the app's own confirm dialog) and vetoes closing the window (`beforeunload`). A stopped backend now shows a "Can't reach MemoryMap. Retrying..." banner with a Retry button instead of buttons that quietly do nothing, and clears on the next successful request.
- Every view has an address: `#/notes/12`, `#/chat/45`, `#/docs/7`, `#/library/images`, `#/settings/appearance`. Reload keeps the view, a bookmark or pasted link opens it, the browser's Back and Forward walk the app's own history, and the window title names the view and what is open in it.
- Density has an Auto setting, the new default: Compact on a window 700px tall or less (a 1366x768 laptop at 125%), the look's own spacing on a taller one. A density chosen in Appearance always wins, and the Dashboard follows it.
- The graph's View menu has a Size rule: connections (the default), length, recency or none.
- On a phone the graph takes the screen's shape: a portrait force layout, the arc running down the screen, the radial and the arc framed whole, and a tall tree framed on its root.
- The "/" menu's look, everywhere a list is picked by typing or browsing: the command palette (Ctrl+K), the `[[` link list and the Library's Create picker now draw the same rows (an icon tile, the name over one line of what it does, and the key that does it without the menu), and the palette and both `[[` lists show the chosen row beside the list on a wide window: what a command does and its key, or a note's first lines.
- Appearance, Atlas and faces, Reduce actions: Off (only blinks, looks and resting stances), Fewer (the default, a third as many unprompted waves and hops) or Normal. At rest Atlas takes stances of its own look: arms folded or a hand on the hip (masculine), hands clasped or a slow sway (feminine).
- The companion's menu has sections: Companion (Atlas, you, the chat's persona or your own character), Atlas look (masculine, feminine or auto), Size, and Settings (Appearance, Profile, Personas), each a flyout with the current choice ticked. Any menu row can now be a flyout of its own.
- Show or hide the companion from anywhere: Ctrl+Shift+Y, or "Show or hide the companion" in the command palette and Find anything. It comes back as whichever companion it was.
- The "/" menu's look, everywhere a list is picked by typing or browsing: the command palette (Ctrl+K), the note box's `[[` link list and the Library's Create picker now draw the same rows (an icon tile, the name over one line of what it does, and the key that does it without the menu), and the palette and both `[[` lists show the chosen row beside the list on a wide window: what a command does and its key, or a note's first lines.
- `POST /links/clip`, the web clipper's backend: a page you choose is fetched once (only while web search is allowed in Settings, and never from an address on this computer or your network, redirects included), reduced to its title, its address and its main text, and kept as a note that search finds by its words. The bookmarklet and its Settings row are not built yet.
- Two notes with the same title in a note's connections (the Connections sheet and the Notes column) can be told apart: each row carries a quiet second cue, the category, or the date written, or the time, whichever separates them. The Connections column also steps aside for the note's sheet when a wide categories sidebar would leave the notes list narrower than 600px, and comes back when there is room.
- In a window 1280 wide or more, the note you open or select in Notes has a Connections column beside the list: the notes it links to, the notes that link to it, the documents, boards and maps it is in, the files it shows, and the forgotten notes close to it. Its close button hides it for good; the notes list's More menu brings it back. In a narrower window the note's own Connections sheet is the way in, as before.
- The privacy receipt's record and its API: `GET /privacy/receipt` answers, from the interpreter's own audit hook on every `socket.connect` and name lookup this process makes, whether anything left this computer since launch and since the ledger began (`egress-ledger.json` in the data folder), which destinations and which feature asked, where the configured model server is and what that means for your notes, and which switches can reach out. Settings, Privacy ("Where your data went") shows it: the verdict, each destination with the feature that asked, since launch or all time, your model's address and who can open the app.
- LAN mode's backend: "Allow other devices on this network" is a switch behind `POST /auth/lan-access` that needs the current password to turn on, and the launcher binds every network address at the next launch only when it is on. A device on the network always needs the password, and a request whose Host names another domain (DNS rebinding) is refused while the app listens beyond this computer. `tests/test_lan_mode.py` runs the real launcher on 0.0.0.0 and checks each safeguard over this machine's own network address. Settings, Account and security has the switch; turning it on asks for your password and says which address to open on the other device.
- The night shift keeps a record of each pass: `GET /night/latest` answers what the last pass read and found (still-visible facts by kind, a few of each with the sentence they came from, and the last pass that found anything when the latest found nothing), and `GET /night/runs/{id}/facts` pages through one pass's findings. The Dashboard's "While you were away" widget (off until added from Widgets) shows it, each finding with Open the note and Dismiss.
- Undo what the AI did since a point in the log: `POST /events/undo` puts back, field by field, every note one actor (the librarian, a skill, a tool) changed after a given event, sends a note it created to the recycle bin, leaves alone any note you changed since (and says so), and answers with the plan first unless told to act. The Dashboard's Recent activity widget offers "Undo what Atlas did", showing what would go back before anything changes.
- Reminders export as a calendar file: `GET /reminders/export.ics` for every upcoming reminder and `GET /reminders/{id}/export.ics` for one, with repeats, priority and an alarm at the due time, and never the words of a private note. "Add to calendar (.ics)" is on each reminder's menu, and "Add all to calendar (.ics)" in the Reminders tab's More menu.
- A numbered source mark in a chat answer shows a preview of its note beside it: the title, the passage the sentence came from, marked, and Open note. Hover or focus shows it, a press keeps it (on a phone a tap opens it), and a press on the preview opens the note; a press on a mark no longer leaves the chat.
- Escape stops an answer being written, and the Stop button holds the keyboard while it streams.
- The privacy receipt's record and its API: `GET /privacy/receipt` answers, from the interpreter's own audit hook on every `socket.connect` and name lookup this process makes, whether anything left this computer since launch and since the ledger began (`egress-ledger.json` in the data folder), which destinations and which feature asked, where the configured model server is and what that means for your notes, and which switches can reach out. The page that shows it is not built yet.
- LAN mode's backend: "Allow other devices on this network" is a switch behind `POST /auth/lan-access` that needs the current password to turn on, and the launcher binds every network address at the next launch only when it is on. A device on the network always needs the password, and a request whose Host names another domain (DNS rebinding) is refused while the app listens beyond this computer. `tests/test_lan_mode.py` runs the real launcher on 0.0.0.0 and checks each safeguard over this machine's own network address. The Settings switch that uses it is not built yet.
- The night shift keeps a record of each pass: `GET /night/latest` answers what the last pass read and found (still-visible facts by kind, a few of each with the sentence they came from, and the last pass that found anything when the latest found nothing), and `GET /night/runs/{id}/facts` pages through one pass's findings. The Dashboard card that shows it is not built yet.
- Undo what the AI did since a point in the log: `POST /events/undo` puts back, field by field, every note one actor (the librarian, a skill, a tool) changed after a given event, sends a note it created to the recycle bin, leaves alone any note you changed since (and says so), and answers with the plan first unless told to act. The Settings surface that offers it is not built yet.
- Reminders export as a calendar file: `GET /reminders/export.ics` for every upcoming reminder and `GET /reminders/{id}/export.ics` for one, with repeats, priority and an alarm at the due time, and never the words of a private note. The buttons that offer it are not built yet.

### Security

- Text from outside the conversation reaches the model fenced as quoted data: note text in every answer's prompt, and the note bodies, file and page text and search snippets in tool results, each between markers a note or page cannot close early, under one line in the system prompts saying text inside them is never an instruction. Once a turn has read a web page, a search result or a file, a web search or page read asks for your confirm, as a destructive tool always does.
- Private notes open only for the sessions that gave the password. The data key was process-wide, so once a device on the network unlocked, this computer's session without a password (sign-in off) read private notes too. The key is now granted per session (setup, unlock, "unlock private notes", and the two account routes that ask for the password again), every other session sees the vault as locked, and the key is forgotten when the last session that gave the password ends, even while one without it is still open.

### Fixed

- Toolbars: one row works on the note edit form, the layout toggle goes back to several rows and a reload keeps the choice (a one-time migration was clearing it), and a group rule never starts or ends a wrapped row.
- Note cards: more room at the top, a gap between cards, and files and sketches clear the metadata row; a file chip's Download and Remove are one size on one centre line. In the rows view the metadata lane no longer draws over the date.
- Collapsed sidebars centre their vertical name under the toggle; the graph popup's tags field has its gap; Settings has a gap under Back up now; the guide panel's own turn is Chat's bubble; the chat thinking line puts its status and rotating lines under the dots.
- SearXNG no longer queries qwant, which answered home instances with a CAPTCHA and a traceback on every search; the ResizeObserver notice is no longer logged as an error.
- The rotating thinking word beside the dots (chat, Ask, the popup agent) no longer draws as a long line with an off-centre, pulsing phrase: it was a fourth `<span>` in the dots' own row, and every dot rule matched it too, stretching a dot's circle into a flattened, filled, bouncing pill. The three real dots now carry their own class, and the word is bold with a static glow instead.
- The chat attach popup (Notes, Documents, Files, Images, Maps) has a proper dialog head (a title, a Close) and a search field with a leading icon, and its category chip can no longer wrap onto a second line. On a phone it opens as a bottom sheet rather than a popover that could land above where the page's own scroll viewport painted and never show at all.
- Settings > Privacy's "Nothing left this computer." notice is centred on its icon rather than a couple of pixels off, and now leads to the Destinations list it is about.
- The Notes list shows four whole cards above the fold at a laptop's height, not three and a partial one.

- Back to Library > Files opened Images: the history now tells the two apart.
- Changing Atlas's look or tune while the large view is open redraws the figure once, whole, instead of putting a full drawing in place of each of its layers.
- The top bar's tabs are centred at every width that holds them, not left beside the space switcher.
- On a phone: the agent's runs are a badge and a row in More instead of a second bar; the status bar meets the tab bar at the end of a page; Library Contents rows fit the card; the lightbox's menu opens on top of it (the page reader was one of its rows) and its actions are one row; one finger on bare canvas pans a board with Select; the graph's legend and zoom stand clear of New note; the Documents editor gives the page most of the screen, and its formatting bar sits above the tab bar instead of over it and is gone while reading.
- The note box's `[[` link list opens at the line being written, in the same panel as the "/" menu, instead of under the whole box, and answers its keys: with the note editor loaded the arrows used to move the caret, Enter wrote a new line and Escape did nothing while the list stayed open.
- Atlas's right foot joins its leg again (a mirrored foot or hand was drawn from the wrong side of the ankle), both feet face forward and a little out rather than sideways, and the feminine look has no fringe over the forehead.
- During the guided tour the corner companion no longer shows through the ring around the control a step points at: it fades and steps away from the ring and the tour's card.
- The corner companion gets out of the way of a popup: when the notifications panel, a menu, a list or a help popover opens over it, it fades at once and then steps aside, and fades back once it is clear.
- The note box's `[[` link list answers its keys again: with the note editor loaded, the arrows moved the caret, Enter wrote a new line and Escape did nothing while the list stayed open.
- Each chat reply shows the face of the persona that answered it: Atlas's own face for Atlas (the default), the persona's face for any other, instead of the app's logo; a 150-turn chat still opens as fast (faster: 346 to 449ms before, 187 to 225ms after) because each face is drawn once and copied.
- In Atlas's large view the nebula drifts and the feminine look's skirt sways, as they do in the corner companion.
- Changing Atlas's look no longer leaves a small Atlas head at the bottom left of the window, under the status bar, one more for every change: the redraw was turning the hidden store of Atlas's colours into a head.
- Atlas, both looks: the arms grow out of the chest rather than off its edge, fuller at the shoulder and tapering to a wrist, with hands that read as hands (the fingertips' notch made them look like claws), resting at easier angles when sitting and floating; the chest's bright four-point star is now a faded constellation of a few dim stars and hairlines; and the nebula is one soft ribbon behind the figure in a haze of light, drifting slowly, instead of two pieces with one crossing in front. The feminine look has no legs or feet: from the waist down it is a translucent skirt of flowing ribbons that end in wisps and sway, and it glides when it walks.
- Any small effect drawn inside one of Atlas's layers now moves ten times a second rather than twenty, which halves its cost (40 to 20 repaints and 20 to 10 layouts a second for one effect). Atlas's mood effects are currently drawn on their own layers and cost nothing either way.
- In Settings, Tools it can use, the two columns' rows line up: a tool with a short description drew its row shorter than the one beside it (27.6px at the default text size), so the rows' edges and fills looked offset between the columns. Each row now fills its place in the grid.
- Scrolling the Timeline costs about half the scripting it did (38 to 20ms a second in the feed, 39 to 15 in the table, a thousand notes): the band on the time strip that marks what is on screen is kept by the browser's own record of which rows are showing, rather than by up to sixteen hit tests a frame.
- No page scrolls sideways because of the status bar. At 820 its items were 13px wider than the window (the notebook count now gives way up to 959, as it already did below 820), and a running background job's name never shortened, so while a job ran every tab scrolled sideways by up to 194px at 1024 and 172px at 768; the name now takes the room the bar has and is cut short with its full text on hover.
- The app's mark is drawn only where it is on screen: the copies in the welcome, the chat's and the map's empty states and Settings' About are drawn when they are first shown, so opening the app draws three instead of six.
- Typing in the chat composer does about half the work per key: a key that only adds to the end of what fits no longer resets and re-measures the box twice.
- Opening the Graph no longer ties the app up while the map settles. On a computer drawing without a graphics card, the first five seconds on a 400-note map kept the page busy for almost all of every second, most of it copying the whole map picture on every frame; they now take about a tenth of that, so the tab answers clicks while its map settles.
- The Timeline remembers how its rows are grouped (category, tag, thread or none) across a reload, as it already remembered the bucket size, the view and the kinds shown.
- The Library's Archived filter, when nothing is archived, says "Nothing archived yet." rather than "No archived yet.", and no longer offers a Create button beside it, since nothing you create lands there.
- The Library's grid is one stop for the Tab key: the card you were last on, then its tick and its menu, with the arrow keys between cards. Tab used to walk every card three times over (400 presses on a thousand-note notebook without leaving the grid), so nothing after it could be reached from the keyboard. The All view's sort is kept across a reload, as the Documents and Images sorts already were.
- The Library and the Timeline scroll smoothly through a thousand notes: the worst frame while scrolling went from 100ms to 33ms on both, and the frames over 32ms from 7 to 5 (Library), 12 to 2 (Timeline) and 10 to 4 (its table), because new cards no longer restyle every card already shown and both lists build their next rows a few milliseconds at a time.
- The corner companion is lighter while it walks: Atlas's steps are paced like its idle motion, 120 to 39 repaints and 60 to 20 layouts a second (round 5).
- With reduced motion on, the ring a keyboard save draws on the button it pressed clears straight away instead of staying on the button, and each save no longer leaves a listener behind that would never run.
- Opening a note card's menu no longer opens the connections column beside the list as it opens: the column narrowed the list and moved the card from under its own menu (118px away at a short window).
- Atlas in the large view keeps its size while it moves: a poke or a mood that moves its whole body (delighted, laughing, sleepy, love, confused) shrank the figure to under half its height for the length of the move, because the move replaced the enlargement; it is enlarged a way the move adds to now.
- With reduced motion on (the system's setting or Appearance's), the companion's right-click menu opens at the companion again instead of hundreds of pixels away or off the top of the window. The reduced-motion rule gave every element a 0.01ms transition rather than none, so a menu, measured straight after it was moved, read where it had been; the rule now stops transitions outright.
- A long conversation opens in less than half the time (a 150-turn chat, 1,028 to 1,172ms down to 410 to 441ms): each reply's label copies one drawing of the app's mark rather than starting its own.
- A code block in a chat answer no longer draws every line as an inline-code chip.
- The empty chat's welcome is one line at every desktop width.
- On a phone the "Grounded in" chips stay inside the answer (they ran 79px past it), a message's action row no longer sits over the message under it, and a chip's tooltip no longer shows Markdown asterisks.
- Right-clicking the round grip in the middle of a selected link (or either end's grip) opens the link's menu, the same one a right-click on the line opens; on a mind map, the cross-link's ring. It did nothing before.
- Leaving the Graph tab in the moment after opening it for the first time no longer throws "graphSimulation is not defined", and the Graph, Library and Documents pages ignore presses until their code has arrived (a fraction of a second on a first visit), so no control on them can call code that is not there yet.
- Exporting the graph as a picture from the SVG renderer no longer fills the browser console with thousands of "Refused to apply inline style" errors; the picture was always right, the noise is gone.
- A big graph names its landmarks. Zoomed out, the best-connected notes in view carry their names instead of none at all; zoomed in, a name that has no room under its dot tries above it, then beside it, so more than twice as many notes are named, and the hubs in the busy middle of the map are among them. Names still never overlap.
- A graph whose notes are all filtered out (every legend entry off, a group hidden, notes hidden from the node menu, or Hide unlinked on a notebook with no links) no longer says "Nothing to map yet" over a full notebook. It says every note is hidden, names what is hiding them, and has one button, Show every note, that brings them back.
- Panning and zooming a busy whiteboard is smooth again: the resize and rotate grips every card carries are left out of the page until a card is hovered or selected, instead of sitting there invisible, which had split a 250-object board into 256 compositor layers. On a slowed-down machine a pan went from 33 long frames to 2.
- Twelve places that swallowed an error without a trace now write the reason to the log: the embedding warm-up, a failed re-index, files skipped by a folder import, filing a note on capture, the near-duplicate check, tag suggestions, re-evaluation, re-filing after new context and the meeting summary. The ruff rule that finds such handlers (BLE001) is now on, so a new one fails the build.
- Three listener leaks the new `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/listenerrounds.js` measures per rebuild, against a control that measures 0: every help '?' put four listeners on the page (fifty at boot, four more each time the chat welcome was rebuilt for a new chat, each holding the old welcome), the chat's Skills dropdown two on the page and one on the Settings checkbox its pace pill mirrors on every rebuild (+35 a skill saved), and an emblem whose holder left the page kept its p5 sketch and the sketch's window listeners (+23 a new chat). The help popovers share one set of page listeners now, the dropdown's go with its build, and a render releases any sketch whose holder is gone. 0 listeners a round after the fix, `leaks.js` still 0/0 across the seven tabs.
- A citation peek is within the keyboard's reach: Enter on a mark moves the focus into the peek (its preview opens the note; Open note beside it), Escape brings it back to the mark, and a peek closed from inside no longer reopens itself.
- When an answer finishes, the chat box takes the focus back only from the Stop button (which held it while the answer streamed), not from wherever you had moved to meanwhile.
- Escape in the chat stops only the answer on screen. An answer still being written into a chat you had left kept streaming there, but an Escape in the next chat's box stopped it unseen.
- A long chat opened in the first moments after the app starts, before the logo's drawing code has loaded, no longer starts one drawing per reply once it arrives: the first reply draws and the rest copy it, as they do later on (40 drawings to 1 on a 40-turn chat).
- Atlas has hands and feet: each limb ends in a small mitten with a thumb on its inner side, or a turned-out foot with a heel, drawn as part of the limb's own outline; its legs are a third of its height on a shorter body, as the reference sheet stands; its hair is drawn full on both looks, the feminine look's a mass rising from the crown into seven wavy locks with one falling forward to the shoulder, and the feminine lower body wears two ribbons that sway with the legs.
- Atlas look on Auto follows Face looks when that says Masculine or Feminine, and otherwise the look you chose for your own face (Profile, Your look); with neither it is the main look. The avatar lab says which decided.
- Atlas's mood moves (a hop when delighted, a giggle, a doze, a sway when in love, a ponder) run on the compositor, as do the sleepy Zs and the love hearts, so a companion at rest in any mood costs no layout and no paint.
- The avatar lab has a Morning review card: both looks, every expression, every pose and every size on one page.
- Private notes stay closed to a session that never gave the password in the moments another session is unlocking, changing the password or re-keying the vault: the key is answered to a granted session or to nobody, never to everybody while the grant list is momentarily empty.
- LAN mode's address check (a page on another site re-pointed at this computer is refused) now runs whenever a request arrives on a network address, not only when the launcher bound the network, so a server started by hand on 0.0.0.0 is guarded too; off loopback a request with no Host is refused.
- A reminder whose title carries line ends exports as one calendar event with the breaks escaped; the escaper is held by a test.
- Atlas's legs are two layers of their own, so the companion's steps, kicks and poses turn a compositor root: a walk paints and lays out nothing where it painted 119 times and laid out 59 times a second before (39 and 20 with the companion's pacing).
- Atlas shuts its eyes with its lids when the companion covers its eyes for a private note; the generic act had flattened them to a line at the top of its head.
- Changing the graph's layout on the Graph tab before its code has arrived no longer throws "setGraphPhysicsEnabled is not defined" and lose the change: the call loads the graph first, as the tab's other entry points do.
- The feminine Atlas's hip sash sways on the compositor, as the tail and the breathing do, rather than repainting its layer every frame while the companion walks (176 paints a second down to 118, the same as the masculine look).
- The About pane's "Take tour again" button is greyed out while the tour is off. The code that did it read `TOUR_ENABLED` at load, before tour.js (the last script) had defined it, so it never ran; it waits for the page now, and a load-order test holds the shape.
- When the AI files a note (on capture, after new context, on re-evaluation) the move is now recorded in the note's history as the filer's, with the category it came from, so History shows where a note was filed and the filing can be undone; before, capture's filing left no record and the other two were recorded as yours with no values.
- The corner companion is lighter while it walks: Atlas's steps are paced like its idle motion, 120 to 39 repaints and 60 to 20 layouts a second (round 5).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Graph: the map's background is no longer black on GPU windows (a low-latency canvas mode, turned on for speed earlier today, is off again).
- Chat: a reopened conversation numbers its citation marks by its Sources panel again (a mark read 1 where its source was 8).
- Settings: the Privacy page's Since launch / All time pill shows which is chosen; the tools grid draws one divider per row in both columns.
- Agent turns no longer fail on Windows with "Invalid format string" (the week line used a Linux-only date flag); a lint now refuses such flags.
- The image viewer loads on its first open instead of at startup, taking about 30 KB off the cold load.
- Dashboard: right-click (or hold) the mark to switch it between the app's logo, Atlas, your face and the greeting's persona; a face in the mark stays inside its circle while it reacts to a click.
- Settings, Tools it can use: each switch now sits level with its tool's name at any text size.
- Appearance, Dashboard mark: Atlas is a choice beside the logo, your face and the greeting persona.
- Undoing what Atlas did to a private note no longer writes back text sealed under a key the vault has since rotated away from; the other fields still go back and the plan names the text as kept.
- The corner companion can be petted (rest the pointer on it for a moment: a happy wiggle), tossed (let it go while moving fast and it flies on, slowing, to a perch near where it comes down) and watches a near pointer with its eyes, as Faces follow the pointer allows (round 5).
- The corner companion notices what happens in the app, quietly and rarely: it puts on its reading glasses and reads along when you open a long note, peeks over when the graph lays itself out again, cheers once when your capture streak grows, yawns now and then at night, covers its eyes when you open a private note and looks towards a new toast; never two within six seconds, and none under Reduce motion.
- The avatar lab and the companion simulator, for anyone working on how the app draws people: `tools/avatar-lab.html` puts the app's own renderers on one page (Atlas in both looks, every mood, pose and size, a reference picture laid over it, the generated faces with Your look's parts), with changes previewed live and nothing saved to the app; `tools/companion-sim.html` runs the real corner companion on a stand-in page. Both are served at `/tools` when the app runs from a source checkout.
- Optional sign-in: Settings, Account and security has "Ask for a password when the app opens", on by default. Turned off (it asks for your current password), the app opens on this computer without the lock screen; another device on your network still needs the password, and private notes stay encrypted and ask for it when you open one ("Unlock private notes"). Lock and Lock everywhere still end the session and drop the key. Recorded in the audit log.
- The corner companion has a size: small, medium or large from its menu or Appearance's Companion size, or any size from the handle at its corner, kept on this computer; it grows and shrinks about the point it touches its perch and is kept off controls at any size. On a dark page a faint light of the accent sits behind it so a dark figure does not sink into the page; on a light one it stands on a soft shadow (INBOX 426 x).
- The corner companion's face changes with what is happening and comes back: glad when you say hello (laughing on the third poke), put out when poked too often, excited at a saved note or an answer, surprised by a bell or an error, intent while an answer is written, heavy-lidded when you have been away and a wave when you come back, and now and then at rest a neighbouring look for a few seconds. Its faces are drawn ahead in idle time, so a reaction swaps a cached picture (under 1ms) (INBOX 426 x).
- Atlas redrawn a third time, traced from the owner's chosen reference sheet with the proportions measured (head a third of the height, no neck, arms two thirds of a head long, eyes a third of the head wide) and the palette sampled from it (a blue body from a sky-blue-white core through periwinkle to a blue-violet shade, violet only at the ear and hair tips and in the nebula, navy for the eyes and the galaxy): a soft bean head on a pear body, all curves, two fluffy rounded ears with an inner ear of galaxy and a star at each tip, a soft fringe swept back over them (a mane of three flowing locks with a curl for the feminine look), large deep eyes with a lit iris and two catchlights, chubby tapered limbs grown from inside the body with round paws and feet, a constellation of linked star points traced inside the chest with a brighter star at the heart, three thin orbit rings with tiny planets about the head, and a tail from the lower back that flows out in an S, the body's blue running into navy galaxy with star dots, ending in a tuft of white starlight (longer for the feminine look). The accent tints only the glow. No filters; every glow is a gradient. The icon is the head, ears and eyes.
- A companion of your own: Appearance's Corner companion has Your own character, with any name and the same part pickers as Your look (look, mood, hair, skin, clothes, headwear, eyewear, what it holds), each From its name until chosen (INBOX 426 e).
- Atlas thinks with a hand at its chin, as the reference sheet draws it.
- Settings, Appearance, Atlas look: masculine (a shorter swept crest with two spikes, straighter brows, broader shoulders) or feminine (a long flowing crest ending in a curl, lashes, arched brows, rounder blush and a star clip); both are the same Atlas. Face looks: Mixed (as before), Masculine or Feminine, for generated faces whose name says nothing either way; a name that does say keeps its own. Your own face can choose its look in Profile, Your look.
- The companion can sit, stand, hang or lean on any panel, toolbar, tile or card on the page, not only the top and bottom bars, and lets go onto the nearest edge within reach. Pick it up by any part of it; its x is gone (Hide is in its menu, which opens at the pointer). It never jumps: it walks, hops or fades to a new place. It no longer startles as you move through the notebook (only for an error, and rarely), and it runs a few errands: it goes to the Reminders button with a bell when one is due, sits on the chat composer while a long answer is written, holds up a tiny note when you save one, and looks at new messages. Atlas is its own choice in Appearance, Corner companion, whatever persona the chat is using.
- Atlas redrawn from the owner's reference sheets: a glossy gel spirit whose round head flows up into one swept crest, a slim soft body with tapered arms and stem legs, star dust and a violet nebula inside the body on a blue to violet gradient, a glowing four-point star in the chest, a short tail ending in a little constellation, and its two rings of stars. The small icon is the head and a short swept curl.
- Atlas wears two rings of stars that float round its body at crossing tilts, passing behind it and in front: a faint glowing line with star dust drifting along it (slowly at rest, faster when it is pleased or busy) and a few star glints of different sizes twinkling, dimmer when it sleeps. Its tail is plain now, with one glint at the tip.
- Atlas looks proud when you save a note and celebrates a capture streak of three days or more (once a day), alongside its other moods.
- Settings, Appearance, Atlas style: the character (the default) or the classic glowing globe, Atlas's first face, with its own moods. Every Atlas follows the choice at once: chat marks, persona rows, the dashboard mark, the welcome, the large view and the corner companion, where the globe floats and wears headphones, reading glasses or a nightcap.
- Atlas as the corner companion does the companion's reactions in its own style: glowing headphones with its tail's notes pulsing to the beat while the app plays sound, a crescent moon hung on its crest late at night, half-moon lenses of light while a long answer streams, a bell of light for a due reminder, one of its notes held up as a lantern, a snapped link between two notes when offline, and its orbit dimming and slowing as it drifts off to sleep.
- Atlas is a character of its own now (atlas.js): a lean star spirit in the accent colour, drawn as one silhouette with one outline (arms, legs and tail grow out of the body rather than sitting on it), a small crest swept back from its crown, a tail, one tapering shape with three of the logo's notes set into it, and light inside its chest (a soft glow with three faint linked points, like light inside a gem) that brightens when it is pleased, dims when it sleeps and lights point by point while it thinks. Almond eyes with a glint. Fifteen expressions (calm, happy, delighted, laughing, thinking, curious, surprised, confused, sleepy, sad, proud, shy, determined, love, worried), each a mix of brows, lids, eyes, mouth, blush, tilt, body squash, crest, tail and star, eased from one to the next, on a glossy body lit from the top left. It breathes, blinks (sometimes twice), sways, and its tail sways and wags when it is pleased; as the companion the tail rests along a ledge when it sits, hangs when it hangs and curls up when it sleeps. Full body from 96px, head and crest for marks, a simplified head under 28px. Its colours follow the accent and the theme.
- Faces are drawn once and moved on the compositor: each face is cut into its moving parts and kept as cached pictures, so the companion no longer lays out the page as it moves (106 layouts a minute before, 7 after; at rest it measures the same as no companion). The companion can be picked up at any moment, even mid-walk, peeking or asleep; let go, it drops onto the surface under it, lands with a squash, looks around once and stays put. It does something every 20 to 60 seconds rather than every few, and its shy peek no longer flashes: it sinks to its eyes, never out of sight, and comes out for a pointer that stays. Faces outside a control can be reached with Tab and opened with Enter; dark hair, hats and suits have a lighter outline so they hold on a dark page. The companion is easier to find: a row in Everything this app does, a line in Help, a card in the Settings tour, and a one-time offer to turn it on.

### Changed
- The README has Atlas at its title and 25 screenshots, retaken on this release in the default look and expanded: Atlas in both looks and ten of its poses, the corner companion, a companion of your own, Your look, Documents in focus mode with its suggestions, Library Activity, the dark theme, a phone and the avatar lab. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md says how the frontend's 46 scripts load and share one scope, and docs/DESIGN.md has the recipes for accent-coloured words, the app's mark, Atlas and the companion.
- The app's own code, one 50,000-line app.js, is now 23 files loaded in its old order (app.js, note-cards.js to spaces-find.js), each under 51 KB gzipped against 740 KB for the one file. Nothing a person sees changes; a warm reload measured about 30 ms slower and a cold load the same, for 22 more requests and 3.6% more bytes on the wire.

### Fixed
- On a touch screen the toast's close button is a 44px target like every other icon button (it was 20px), and screen readers no longer hear the chat's Export and Delete twice.
- The corner companion's walk, kick and dangle move Atlas's feminine look too: its ribbon lower body sways from the hips where the masculine look moves its legs (it had no legs, so those moved nothing).
- Settings, Appearance, Atlas look has Auto (follows Face looks), the default: the select used to read Masculine while nothing was stored and Atlas followed Face looks anyway. A Face looks change redraws an Atlas on Auto at once.
- Documents: the writing suggestions no longer ask for title case in headings. The grammar checker's rule wanted every heading in title case, the opposite of the sentence case the app writes in, and it was most of the suggestions on a document written that way (four of six on the README's draft).
- Documents: the expanded formatting toolbar's own buttons no longer take a row to themselves; when they would, layout and collapse are left to the document's ⋯ menu and line numbers moves to the end of the first row.
- The graph's empty state shows the app's turning logo, as the chat's does, instead of a generic network icon.
- Links and accent-coloured words use a text-safe shade of the accent in every palette and mode, so a bright accent (rose on paper, a picked yellow) no longer turns them unreadable; fills keep the accent itself.
- On a phone, the Notes capture toolbar wraps instead of cutting off Bulleted list, Task, Link and Preview when the Library has not been opened yet. On a tablet-width window a toast sits in the lower corner instead of over the Notes sub-tabs (Chat keeps it at the top, clear of the composer). The light theme's warning and danger text is one step darker, so "Changes notes", "Forget everything learned" and the suggestions count pass contrast on grey rows.
- The guided tour follows the control it points at while the page settles or content loads above it, instead of keeping the place it measured first; the companion card no longer needs Next then Back to move off its control, and the companion step is shown even when its settings group is folded (the tour opens it, and folds it again at the end). With no mind map yet, the mind maps section says so on its one card. Atlas in the guide's head is a round avatar the height of its title, centred beside it, instead of a figure hanging below the head.
- Documents, focus mode: "Fill the whole screen" fills it in the desktop window (it asks the window itself; the page's own full screen only filled the page). In a narrow suggestions panel the header's buttons are one row of icons with their names on hover, beside the count. On a touch screen the formatting toolbar's own buttons (More, line numbers, collapse) are full 44px squares.
- Library, Activity: one line per record in both views (when, what, the detail), where the grid had squeezed the detail to a column of single letters; a settings change reads in words ("Mute notifications except reminders: off") and keeps its underscores. The Bin's selection tick keeps a gap from the card's menu and no longer sits on the date in Rows.
- Settings and every tab: after picking a Settings section or a tab with the mouse, the arrow keys, Page Down, Space, Home and End scroll the page you opened. In Settings they used to jump to the next section and back to its top; on a tab, Home and End switched tabs.
- Settings: a setting's field sits at the right end of its row, as in Appearance, and Profile no longer ends with an empty card.
- Settings scrolls smoothly with glass on: it no longer blurs the page behind it, which was redrawn on every scrolled frame (about 100ms a frame in a software-drawn window, 17ms now).
- Settings, Skills, Templates and Personas: each row is its name and one line of what it does, 66px instead of 78px; the graph's node sheet on a phone meets the 44px tap size; on a phone a board's selection bar moves to the foot of the canvas when the top would cover what you selected.
- Documents: the formatting toolbar refits when its tools change, not only when its width does; on a narrow toolbar the layout toggle goes behind More first; in focus mode the suggestions panel keeps the width you dragged it to.
- Documents: the writing suggestions panel fits the width it is given. Its header wraps instead of running off a narrow right-hand panel (Dictionary and the close were cut off and the panel scrolled sideways), and a finding cut short shows its whole text on hover. In focus mode a Suggestions button on the floating bar opens the panel as a side panel, and the page makes room for it.
- Documents: every formatting tool can be reached at every width. The one-row toolbar no longer scrolls sideways with its own buttons pinned over Insert; what does not fit folds behind a More button that opens the rest in place, and a phone gets the same instead of a hidden scroller. Focus mode gains a Tools button that brings back the document's dock and formatting toolbar without leaving it.
- The app's logo turns again everywhere it is drawn (lock screen, dashboard, top bar, chat, About, the welcome, the getting-started card and the chat's own replies), including with the system's reduced-motion setting on, which had stopped every one of them; the new chat's welcome keeps its logo on a short window instead of dropping it.
- Settings: every folded group head is the same height (the ones with a '?' stood 11px taller), and on touch screens they, and the icon buttons in dialogs, meet the 44px tap size.

- Notes: the Favourite, Copy and more-actions buttons on every note card could not be pressed, with a mouse or a finger (the corner that holds them let every press through to the card); they work again. On a phone the notifications panel sat 34px off the left of the window and now fits it, and a dialog's buttons and a menu's rows meet the 44px touch floor (they were 36px).
- Settings: Keyboard shortcuts, Extras and Skills fold the same way as Appearance (the first group open, the rest remembered): Keyboard shortcuts 2,621 to 1,752px, Extras 2,536 to 2,044px, Skills 2,615 to 2,118px, with the skill form opening itself when a skill is edited. Three package descriptions lost text meant for developers: a raw command line, and a note that read "asked for directly".
- Settings, Appearance: its eight groups fold (the Themes group open, each group's open state remembered in this browser), and the companion, Atlas style and look, face looks and dashboard mark rows have their own "Atlas and faces" group, one click from the top. The pane is 1,298px tall with the rest folded, was 4,022; a closed group is one 51px row, and a "?" in a closed head opens its group.
- Chat: with no model running, "No model connected" was said by the header badge and again by the composer notice under it; the notice (what still works, and the button that connects one) is the one statement now, and the badge returns with the model. The "Ask Atlas: ..." offer in empty states and help popovers is a suggestion chip like the chat starters, not an underlined link (28px tall, ink on a hairline pill, the compass in front).
- Generated faces have more character and a presentation you choose: Settings, Appearance, Face looks is Masculine, Feminine or Neutral (the default), and Profile, Your look adds Neutral; it is never read from a name, or from a word in one. It picks the hair set (masculine adds an undercut, spikes, a mohawk, slicked back and a buzz with a line; feminine adds long curls and a messy fringe), the brows (heavy and straight, fine and arched, or between, in the hair colour), the jaw and cheeks, lashes, and facial hair (stubble, a short beard, a moustache: masculine only). Every face also gets two traits from its name: a beanie, cap, headphones or hood; round glasses or shades; freckles, a scar through one brow, an earring or a nose plaster; a smirk or a raised brow; a name whose words already dress it gets one small one at most.
- Generated people look like a designed set: a natural skin tone (seven, porcelain to deep) with a hair colour from a natural palette chosen to read against it, and thirteen hand-drawn hairstyles (textured crop, side-swept fringe, soft quiff, curtains, tousled, short curls, wavy to the chin, long and straight, long waves, bob, bun, ponytail, locs), each with volume past the head, a parting or a fringe that goes one way, a hairline that frames the forehead, a back layer, a cast shadow under the fringe, a highlight sweep and a few strands of texture. Profile, Your look gains Hair colour and Skin; hairstyles saved under the old names still work. Creatures keep their soft gel coats.
- Generated faces are drawn more cleanly: the body, hair and clothes come from one of twelve colour pairs chosen to sit together (each checked at 3:1 on the light and dark page), instead of three colours rolled apart; the default eyes are big dark irises with two catchlights, the crown of the head has a soft sheen, hungry faces lick their lip rather than stick their tongue out, the buns are one bun on the crown (two read as bear ears), and short hair and the quiff sweep to one side rather than sitting like a helmet. Sushi is a thing to hold or to wear in the hair. At 28px and under a face keeps one cue that breaks its outline (a creature loses its hat), drops the specks and draws a thicker line; a "zz" or a question mark moves beside the head when a hat is on it; the headband sits clear of the brows.
- Generated faces read a name more carefully: a plain first name (Brayden, Sarah) is a clean, friendly default with one hairstyle and no costume, animal or held thing, and its look follows Profile, Your look or Settings, Appearance, Face looks rather than a guess; a handle drives at most two things to wear or hold, chosen by salience (Sushicraft563 holds a pickaxe with sushi in its hair, SushiLord wears a crown and holds sushi), one per head, face, hand and body; numbers only change the variety; "cooked" no longer puts on a chef's hat and "Janice", "Clover" and "Angela" are plain names again; at most one flavour (a wink, a sweat drop) is drawn, and only where it does not fight the mood.
- Settings, About no longer receives the full path of the notebook's folder from the server: a folder in your home folder is shown as ~/..., anything else by its name, so the page gives away nothing about the server's disk.
- The app no longer follows a model server's redirect to a different address: a request to your configured model stays on that address, and a redirect elsewhere is reported instead of followed. A redirect within the same server still works.
- Internal: the check that every module reaching the network is reviewed now sees downloads made without the requests library too (the optional extras and embedding models), and both are recorded as fetching only addresses the app ships.
- Import from path reads only folders inside your home folder or the notebook's data folder, and skips any file in the folder that links somewhere outside it. A folder elsewhere can still be imported with Import folder, which uploads the files you choose.
- Wrong passwords from one device no longer lock the owner out: each address earns its own wait after five wrong tries, and a much larger limit across every address together still slows a guesser who keeps changing address.
- Pictures and files no longer carry your session key in their address. Unlocking sets a cookie that only picture and file requests can use and no script can read, so the key stays out of browser history, the server's log and any note an image address is pasted into. The Library's Download on a file saves through the app's own save path, which also works in the desktop window.
- Link suggestions and tensions open faster on a large notebook: the comparison of every pair of notes is kept until a note's meaning changes, instead of being redone on every request (5,000 notes: 322 ms to 104 ms for a repeat request; 2,000 notes: 114 ms to 28 ms).
- Ask and chat find related notes faster on a large notebook: the semantic half of retrieval scores against the vectors already held in memory instead of reading every stored vector from the database for each question (5,000 notes: 19 to 74 ms before, about 1 ms after; 400 notes: 1.6 ms to 0.2 ms). A note edited, deleted or re-indexed a moment ago is scored on what is stored now.
- A toast's action button (Undo, Turn on) drew white text on white in the light theme; it is a ghost button now.
- Documents: the AI assistant's head is one row (the title and its help on the left, History and Close as quiet icon buttons on the right), and Edit / Write / Remove is a full-width control of three equal segments: the unchosen verbs are in the normal ink rather than the grey that read as disabled, and the chosen one is bold with an accent ring and icon.
- Documents, tables in Live view: the arrow keys keep the column from row to row, Enter goes to the cell below (adding a row at the end, in the same column), and the arrows leave a table at the start or end of the document, making the blank line markdown needs. Rows pasted from a spreadsheet fill the cells from the caret, adding rows and columns as needed, in one undo step; pasted outside a table they become a new table. The table's menu (rows, columns, alignment, delete) now sits on the row you are editing instead of on the header.
- Documents: the editor's top bar is one row where the window allows it (breadcrumb and title on the left; save state, Edit/Read, AI edit, focus and the menu on the right), and wraps its actions whole onto a second row only when the pane is too narrow. The "Documents" breadcrumb reads as a place rather than a button, and a long title in the outline breadcrumbs ends in an ellipsis instead of being cut at both ends. At 1440x900 and 1366x768 the first line of text moves up 49px (228px to 179px).
- Documents: focus mode is on the dock (the corners button beside the menu) and on F11. It gives the page the whole window: the top bar, tabs, sidebar, dock, formatting strip, breadcrumbs and status bar all go, the text stays at its reading width in the middle, and a small floating bar keeps the title, the word count, the save state, full screen (where the browser allows it) and Exit. The bar fades while you write and comes back when you move the pointer; Escape or F11 leaves; a reload in the same session keeps it. Works in Live, Source, Split and Read. At 1440x900 the first line moves from 228px to 71px down and the writing area from 520px to 830px tall.
- Internal: `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/facesheet.js` draws the generated characters' sheet (the full figure at 104px, the head at 104px and 28px, light or dark, with each name's reading), for judging a change to the faces by eye before and after.
- Internal: `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docroom.js` measures the documents editor's room: every band of chrome above the first line, and the writing column's share of the window, at 1440x900 and 1366x768 (228px of chrome above the first line; the column 520px tall, 58% of 900).
- Every generated face is now a small designed character in one silhouette (a head that flows into its body, stubby limbs, one outline, one gradient, a contact shadow), with the name's reading drawn onto it: its colour, a species' ears, muzzle, beak, tail, wings or tentacles, hair and clothes for people, hats, eyewear and the thing in its hand. Lists, chat bubbles and pickers show its head; the large view and the companion show all of it.
- The corner companion is alive and finds its own place on each page: it hangs from the top bar or a panel's underside, sits on a panel's top edge with its legs dangling (tucked where they would cover something), stands at the bottom bar, and never covers a control. Drop it on a panel and that page keeps it there (other pages keep choosing); carried, it swings with wide eyes, and let go over open space it falls to the edge below. It looks around, turns, blinks, stretches, yawns, naps, hops, waves, scratches its head, kicks its legs, swings, hangs like a sloth, by one hand or by its feet, and peeks shyly from behind a panel, ducking when the pointer comes near. It reacts to you: drowsy after three idle minutes and asleep after eight, waking with a stretch; it watches and nods along while you type, thinks and puts on reading glasses during a long answer, cheers a new note, jumps at an error, holds up a bell when a reminder is due, wears headphones while the app plays sound, a nightcap late at night, lights a lantern when the theme turns dark, and holds its unplugged cable offline. Reduce motion and Avatar animation Off keep it still.
- Settings, Profile, Your look says how Shuffle works: it keeps what your name says (words for a mood or a costume) and any part you chose, and redraws the rest (colours, hair, clothes, smile and personality).
- Profile & preferences saves itself, like every other Settings section (no Save button; a shuffle or a pick is kept at once). The dashboard greeting's persona shows its face beside the picker. The corner companion has its own menu on right-click or a long press: say hello, enlarge, back to its corner, keep it in any of the four corners, hide. Pointer-follow is stronger (eyes and head turn further, with a slight lean).
- Your own face, your way: Settings, Profile, Your look has Shuffle (another take on your name, as many times as you like), Back to my name's own, and pickers for mood, hair, clothes, headwear, eyewear and what you are holding; saved with the profile and applied everywhere your face appears.
- Atlas greets a new person on the welcome's first card, pleased and animated, with a line in its own voice; the later cards keep the logo. Faces are now animated by default (Settings, Appearance, Avatar animation: Always), and only the faces on screen move.
- Atlas has a face of its own, and moods: a small globe in the accent colour glowing in a night sky with sparkles, big glossy eyes and a small smile, with the logo's ring of linked notes orbiting the head and a north star above. It thinks (eyes up, a thought bubble) while a chat turn runs, beams when it lands, looks surprised when it fails, and dozes after ten idle minutes or in the small hours; every Atlas on screen changes together. It is Atlas in the persona list, the picker, the large view and the companion; the live logo stays in the status bar, the chat's reply label and everywhere else it was.
- Faces you can meet: click one for a hop and a line in its own voice, and a face outside a control opens large with what it was read as. New Appearance settings: Faces follow the pointer (eyes and heads turn a little towards the mouse, only faces on screen, one update a frame), Corner companion (you or the chat persona, draggable, remembered, hidden by its own x; off by default) and Dashboard mark (the logo, your face, or the greeting persona; the logo stays everywhere else).
- Chat: each reply shows the face and name of the persona that wrote it, kept with the saved turn, so switching persona mid-conversation relabels nothing already on the page and a reopened chat shows who answered each message. The default assistant keeps the app's emblem; replies saved before this read as the default. Copying the transcript names each reply by its writer too.
- Internal: the generated faces moved out of app.js into avatars.js, loaded straight after it, which brings the gzipped app.js back under its size bound (762,903 to 736,191 bytes).
- Generated avatars read the name they are drawn for. Mood words ("depressed", "overly dramatic", even "exitable"), animals ("panda"), costumes ("wizard" is a hat, "academic" is glasses), typing ("ALL CAPS", "...", ":)", emoji, 666), internet words ("lol", "meh", "uwu") and stacked flavours ("wink", "ahhhh", "cooked") each change the face; a name that makes no sense becomes a small mutant whose eyes, stalks, spots and fangs come from its letters (the helixlabs idea); any other name gets a stable personality of its own. Villains get an evil grin ("muahaha", "evil overlord", 😈), and there are dead, sick, starstruck, cute and tipsy faces, vampire fangs, a clown nose, cowboy and party hats, a ninja mask and a space helmet (one hat per head). Hands too: a thumbs up, a peace sign, a wave, the middle finger (only when the name asks for it), and things held (a beer, a glass of wine, a hot drink, a sword, a magnifying glass, a microphone, a book, a phone, a flower, pizza, a donut, a balloon), a full table flip for "(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻", money eyes for "stonks", and every name its own smile (toothy, lopsided, a big D, buck teeth, a gap) and small features (freckles, a beauty mark, lashes, a nose). Not everyone has hands: angels, birds and dragons get feathered or bat wings, fairies and bees see-through ones, krakens and octopuses tentacles, walkers and penguins feet, and a mutant rolls its own or none; they flap, sway and step when animated. The zoo grew to forty (frog, bear, bird, duck, hamster, sheep, cow, deer, unicorn, dragon, dino, shark, snake, axolotl, crab, raccoon, hedgehog, sloth, capybara, bee and more), wings come in seven kinds (angel, bird, dragon, bat, fairy, bee, butterfly), eyewear in eight (round, square, monocle, goggles, 3D, star and heart shades, a cyber visor), and there are pirate tricorns, karate headbands, tiaras, caps, beanies, flower crowns, bandanas and beards. Faces have hair (long, bob, pigtails, buns, ponytail, curly, short, spiky, quiff, buzz) and small touches (bows, earrings, lipstick, a flower clip, stubble); a name that says "girl", "queen" or "sis" draws from the feminine styles, one that says "bro", "king" or "dad" from the masculine, and a first name is never taken as either. In Always mode only the faces on screen move. Tools too: a controller for gamers ("gaming", "xbox", 🎮), a diamond pickaxe for crafters and miners, an axe, a hammer, a toy blaster, a bow and arrow, a wand, a fishing rod, a paintbrush, a spear and a trident. Mythical creatures (mermaid, elf, goblin, troll, gnome, genie, mummy, zombie, minotaur, Medusa, cyclops, phoenix, yeti), and everyday people in everyday clothes: shoulders under the face in a T-shirt, hoodie, shirt and tie, blazer, jumper or scoop neck with a necklace; "office" and "CEO" wear a suit, "street" a hoodie, "prom" a dress. Hover a face for what it was read as. New Appearance setting: Avatar animation (on hover, always, off) makes them blink and act out their mood; Reduce motion stops it.
- Notes and documents: the "/" menu is a block inserter. Grouped (Recent, Basic, Structure, Callouts, Media, Embeds, Advanced, AI, Templates), each row an icon tile, a name, one line of what it does and the markdown it writes; a preview of the block beside the list on wider windows; letters-in-order search; Tab and Shift+Tab jump between groups; the blocks you used last come first. New blocks: headings 1 to 3, quote with attribution, toggle, two and three columns, table of contents, section break and strong divider, every callout kind, maths block, link card, date and time; a code block asks for its language next.
- Notes and documents: blocks render as blocks everywhere. Callouts come in Obsidian's thirteen kinds plus a toggle, each with its own icon and colour in light and dark; columns sit side by side in notes and chat answers too; `[TOC]` lists the headings as links; `***` and `___` draw a section break and a strong rule; a quote ending `-- Name` shows its attribution; `$$ ... $$` is typeset in Read view and notes; an embedded document is a card. The HTML export styles all of them.
- Documents: a rendered block has a small bar while you point at it: change a callout's kind or folding, jump to the block in the editor, copy its markdown, or delete it (with Undo). In Live view the callout's icon changes its kind.
- Generated avatars read the name they are drawn for. Mood words ("depressed", "overly dramatic", even "exitable"), animals ("panda"), costumes ("wizard" is a hat, "academic" is glasses), typing ("ALL CAPS", "...", ":)", emoji, 666), internet words ("lol", "meh", "uwu") and stacked flavours ("wink", "ahhhh", "cooked") each change the face; a name that makes no sense becomes a small mutant whose eyes, stalks, spots and fangs come from its letters (the helixlabs idea); any other name gets a stable personality of its own. Hover a face for what it was read as. New Appearance setting: Avatar animation (on hover, always, off) makes them blink and act out their mood; Reduce motion stops it.
- One running copy per notebook. Launching the desktop app while it is
  already open now brings the open window forward instead of starting a
  second server on the same data folder, which used to run the migrations
  and background work against the SQLite file the first copy had open before
  failing to bind the port. A running server writes `instance.lock` (port,
  pid, a token) into the data folder; a launch checks it against `/health`
  and asks the running copy to focus its window (`POST /instance/focus`,
  guarded by that token). A lock whose port is silent and whose process is
  gone, or past a 90 second boot grace, is stale and is taken over. Settings,
  About, Advanced has "Open a new window on each launch", off by default: on,
  a second launch opens another window onto the same running server, never a
  second server. The rules are pure functions tested in
  `tests/test_instance_lock.py` (24 tests, launcher driven with a fake
  pywebview); not verified against a real pywebview window, Windows'
  foreground rules or two windows sharing one WebView2 profile.
- Settings, Preferences is now Profile & preferences, your own local
  profile, and sits second in the settings list, right after Models. It opens
  on a head with your mark (the same generated face your chat bubbles wear,
  drawn from your name), and the name and About me come first; About me stops
  at the 600 characters Atlas reads, with a count. The Settings head carries
  your mark too, and pressing it opens the profile from any pane. Renaming
  yourself repaints every mark at once, including the bubbles already in the
  chat (`paintUserMarks`, DESIGN.md's new "A mark generated from a name"
  recipe, with its lint in `tests/test_ui_recipes.py`). Measured by
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/profile.js` at 1440 and 390, light and dark: no
  overflow with a 52-character name, the head button the guide button's
  height. The help chat's background librarian answer now points at
  Background tasks, where that switch has lived for a while.
- Atlas now knows your name as well as your "About me", while the profile
  switch is on. Both reach the prompt through one function,
  `librarian.profile_from_config`, and the about text is capped at its first
  600 characters there: the API still accepts 2,000 so an older, longer
  profile keeps saving, but the system message it lands in is resent on every
  round of every turn. The whole profile context is held to a quarter of the
  prose budget by `tests/test_user_profile_context.py`.
- Internal: the popup agent (Ctrl+K) moved out of app.js into its own palette.js, loaded at boot after timeline.js, which brings the gzipped app.js back under its size bound (752,031 to 730,546 bytes).
- Library: a file row's facts line is one register. The kind, size, date, reading state, reader link and "Used in" share one size and one line box (they sat on four sizes and three tops), split by the same middot, and "Read this" is an accent link rather than a boxed button.
- Documents: the writing dictionary is a cleaner settings sheet. One field finds a word as you type and adds it on Enter, the list is quiet rows whose remove appears when you point at one, the list can be exported and imported as a .txt file (import only adds), and spelling, grammar and smart quotes are ordinary settings rows with a line each.
- Notes, Capture: Template opens a picker like the documents' one. A click chooses a template and shows its text; Use this template (or Enter, or a double click) fills the box, and only then asks before replacing what you have typed. Picking used to fill the box on every name the dropdown passed.
- Documents: the suggestions panel can sit on the right of the editor instead of under it: the button in its head switches, the column resizes by dragging its edge (or with the arrow keys, double-click to reset), and both are remembered. On a narrow window it stays under the editor.
- Documents: Check with AI works in place. Its findings arrive in the suggestions panel as the model writes them (the exact words, why, and a fix), underlined in the text, each with Apply and Dismiss, and the button is Stop while it runs. With no model connected the panel says so, with a button to Settings, Models. Discuss in chat opens the chat with the document attached and nothing typed for you.
- Documents: autofill in markdown and text documents. Type `lorem` and press Enter (or Tab) for a paragraph of filler text, `lorem20` for twenty words, `table 3x4` for a three by four table; on a line of their own, `today`, `date`, `now`, `time`, `todo`, `callout`, `hr`, `toc` (the headings as links) and `sig` (your name from Settings). `:` and two letters offer emoji by name. The list shows what each writes, and its first line appears after the caret before you take it. `**`, `_`, backticks and brackets close themselves, and Enter on an empty list item ends the list (it used to add a blank line). Settings, Preferences has Smart quotes and dashes, off by default.
- Settings, Packages: Run Python files (Pyodide). Run on a .py document runs it in the same sandbox as JavaScript, with no network and none of your notes: print output and errors in the Output panel with a link to each line, Stop, the ten-second stop (counted from when the script starts, not while the runtime loads) and the 500-line cap. Before it is installed, Run says so and its Install Python button opens the Settings row. The standard library only; about 7 MB, downloaded once and offline from then on.
- Settings, Packages: Tool calling without Ollama (needle). With no model server running, a request that needs a tool (make a note, set a reminder, search) is still carried out by needle, a 121M-parameter tool-calling model run inside MemoryMap; it writes no replies, so the answer is what the tools said. Telemetry is switched off (NEEDLE_TELEMETRY=0 and DO_NOT_TRACK=1 are set before the engine loads). Apache-2.0, about 36 MB, and offered only where a prebuilt engine exists (Linux, macOS and Windows on x86-64 and ARM64).
- Packages can now be pinned downloads as well as pip packages: a fixed URL and sha256 per file, checked before anything is kept, unpacked into the data folder, no restart. MEMORYMAP_EXTRAS_MIRROR installs the same files from a local folder for a computer with no internet.
- Uninstalling on Windows asks whether to delete the downloaded optional
  packages too (notes are always kept).
- ArrowUp and ArrowDown in an empty chat box step through the messages you
  sent; Ctrl+Y redoes, as the board's buttons already said.
- Chat, Web panel: redesigned as a reading pane. The head is the title, a dot for the search engine's state (its words on hover) and a menu to start or stop SearXNG, open Web search settings or clear recent searches; one search field with the icon inside, Enter to search and Stop only while a search or a page is loading; results as a list with the site's letter, arrow keys and Enter, a right-click menu, Copy link and Cite in chat; recent searches as rows. The reader has a Results link, Find in this page (Ctrl+F counts the page, not the tab), Copy link and Open in your browser beside it, one row of Ask about this, Cite in chat, Save as note and Bookmark, and the page as prose with no box round it and one scrollbar. Cite in chat attaches the page to your next message as a chip. The panel opens at its default width rather than its minimum, and cannot be dragged so wide that the conversation is squeezed.
- Chat: your own messages carry a small mark generated from your profile name (or "You"), on the bubble's corner, so nothing in the bubble moves; the persona picker shows the chosen persona's mark beside it.
- Persona marks are faces now: a head in one of the category colours over a ground in another, with eyes and a mouth, all drawn from the name. The closest two of 23 differ in 29.8% of their pixels (the old marks: 5.6%).
- Documents, New from a template: a click chooses a template and shows its page; Use this template (or Enter, or a double click) makes it. The arrow keys move the choice and the first row is chosen when the dialog opens.
- Settings, Templates: every template can be edited, the built-in ones included. An edited built-in keeps its name, says Edited, and Reset brings the original back; the Capture dropdown offers the edited text.
- The Guide (Atlas) can answer "what are all the keys and hidden features of" each surface: a controls reference for the whiteboard, the mind map, the document editor, the code editor, the graph, chat, notes, the Library, the Timeline, Reminders and the Dashboard, plus a hidden features entry (the command palette, Find anything, the m chord's every letter, keyboard menus, select mode, the notes filter's operators). Written from each surface's own key tables, and a test fails when a key bound in the app is missing from the guide. A question that names a surface and asks about its keys or controls gets that surface's reference; "what does F12 do" finds the entry that documents F12.
- Graph: Similarity draws each note's two closest matches rather than every pair (200 lines to 58 and 1,701 crossings to 39 on a 42-note notebook), darker and wider for a closer match, dashed and beneath the links, with a Strength slider to keep only the closest, a legend key and the scores on the note you point at. Length by similarity now works on the default renderer. Labels no longer sit on another note's dot. The options panel has Reset to defaults, with Undo.
- A note's menu has Translate: it opens the note in Write with Atlas, set to
  translate into the last language you picked.
- Documents: F12 goes to where the name at the caret is defined in a code file, Shift+F12 lists every use of it (not the ones in strings or comments), and Ctrl+Shift+F opens Find anything on documents with the selection or the word.
- Documents: Run (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) for a .js or .html file: the script runs in a sandbox with no network and none of the notebook's storage, its console and its errors come back in an Output panel under the editor with a link to each line, an HTML file's page shows above them, and Stop (or ten seconds of a script that never finishes) ends it. TypeScript and Python say what they would need.
- Documents: snippets for Java, C#, C, C++, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, R, SQL and shell (main, sout, prop, fori, iferr, match, sel and more), and a few more for JavaScript, TypeScript and Python, offered in the completion list and written in the file's own indent.
- Documents: sticky scroll in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and CSS files: scrolled into a function, class or rule, its first line (and its parents') stays pinned at the top of the pane, and a click on it goes there.
- Documents: Alt+Z wraps a code file's long lines (and unwraps them), and the document menu's Editor and layout group has Wrap long lines and Show whitespace for any file that is not prose; both are remembered.
- Documents: a code file's outline and breadcrumb list its functions, classes and methods (a CSS file's rules), and the palette's Go to a symbol lists them at the caret. Fixed: a Python or shell file's outline showed every `#` comment as a heading.
- Documents: code files draw quiet indentation guides at each indent step and colour bracket pairs by depth, as VS Code does; brackets inside strings and comments are left alone.
- Documents: hovering a CSS property, an HTML element or an HTML attribute in a code file shows one line on what it is for, and a property's values.
- Documents: a colour in a CSS file (or an HTML file's style block) has a small swatch beside it, and a click on it opens the colour picker; the picked colour is written back as hex or rgb(), whichever it was.
- Documents: renaming a tag in an HTML, XML or JSX file renames its matching tag as you type (one undo takes both back), and XML files close a tag on `>` and finish `</` as HTML and JSX already did.
- Documents: Emmet in JSX (inside a .js file's JSX, writing `className`) and XML as well as HTML and CSS, and Emmet's own editing commands in the palette for code files: wrap the selection with an abbreviation, and balance outward or inward to select the enclosing tag.
- Documents: Ctrl+/ in a code file comments by the language at the caret, as VS Code does (`//` inside an HTML file's script, `/* */` in its style, `{/* */}` for a JSX child), and Shift+Alt+A block-comments the selection. Fixed: Ctrl+/ on a line of prose replaced the line with a lone "/", and a .sql document could not be opened at all.
- Documents: code files complete as you type, as VS Code does. In HTML, `!` then Enter writes the HTML5 page and Emmet abbreviations (`div.card>ul>li*3`, `a[href]`, `p{text}`) expand from the list or with Tab; in CSS, a property is followed by its own values (`display: ` offers `flex` and `grid`, `color: ` the colours) and `m10` or `df` expand; the chosen suggestion's rest shows after the caret in muted ink and Tab takes it.
- Translation in Write with Atlas: a Translate chip and a "Translate into"
  group of 19 languages in the kind menu. The local model translates
  meaning, keeps every fact, name, number and the markdown, and leaves code
  and links alone; the chip remembers the last language picked.
- Personas each get a mark generated from their name (the same name always
  draws the same mark, nothing stored), so a list of them is told apart at
  a glance; Atlas keeps the app's own emblem.
- Grammar checking in documents and note boxes, on this computer: Harper
  (Apache-2.0, vendored) underlines agreement, "a" or "an", its or it's and
  the like with a double line, files them under Grammar in the suggestions
  panel and offers its fixes in the word's own menu. It loads on the first
  prose document or note box (nothing at boot; 1.75 s cold, about 100 ms per
  check of 1,400 words, all in a worker) and the dictionary dialog turns it
  off (INBOX 401).
- Suggest changes, in a document's ⋯ menu: what you type is underlined on
  green and what you delete is struck through instead of disappearing, each
  one accepted or rejected from its own menu, or all at once; the status bar
  says the mode is on and counts the changes. The marks are CriticMarkup in
  the text (`{++added++}`, `{--removed--}`), so they save, sync, show in
  history and survive a .md download like any other words (INBOX 404).
- Read aloud, in a document's ⋯ menu: reads from the caret, or just the
  selection, in this computer's own voice, one sentence at a time with that
  sentence highlighted; Stop on the status bar or Esc. Markdown is read as
  words, fenced code and suggested deletions are skipped (INBOX 404).
- An accessibility check in the suggestions panel: a skipped heading level
  (with the right level offered as the fix), an image with no description,
  and link text that says nothing on its own ("click here", a bare web
  address), each underlined with a dashed line (INBOX 404).
- Word round trip: a .docx export now carries tables, links (web and mail
  addresses only), nested and task lists, code blocks and strikethrough, and
  suggested changes as Word's own tracked changes; opening a .docx reads all
  of those back, including a reviewer's tracked changes as suggestions to
  accept or reject (INBOX 404).
- The guided tour walks through every main feature, one section after
  another: Notes, Chat, Graph, Library, Boards, Mind maps, Timeline,
  Reminders, Settings and the status bar each open the feature and point at
  three to five of its controls. The last card of a section offers the next
  one by name ("Next: Chat") or Finish, and the count is per section. Nothing
  is created on the way: with no mind map yet, the tour points at New mind
  map and says what it makes (INBOX 398).
- Library cards: the select tick no longer sits on top of the card's menu
  button, so pressing the menu opens it instead of ticking the card.
- A file's menu in the Library offers Ask Atlas about this, like every other
  object's menu; the reminder menu's entry uses the same icon as the rest.
- Files: a file's menu in the Library offers Ask Atlas about this, the last kind of object without it; the reminder row's version wears the same chat icon as every other.
- Chat: with no model connected, the Chat tab says so above the composer, names Notes, Ask as the place that answers without one, and carries the Connect a model button, as Ask, the popup agent and the writing desk already did. Before, the box was grey and only a tooltip said why.
- Dashboard: Ask AI and the empty notebook's Ask your notebook go to Notes, Ask when no model is running (it answers from your notes without one) and to Chat when one is, with the caret in the box. Before, both opened a disabled Chat box with the caret nowhere.
- Library: a new notebook's first screen says what to make and offers Create beside the sentence, instead of "Nothing of this kind yet" (the activity log was being counted as things you had made); a kind with nothing in it names itself ("No meetings yet"). The Create picker now offers a board and a file upload too, seven rows in all.
- The Atlas guide panel is redesigned as one surface: the chat sits straight on the card instead of in a tinted box inside it, the head is one row (35px, was 63) with its subtitle on one line and three quiet, equal controls, the empty panel greets you like the Chat tab does (a title, one line, and the three questions as centred chips), and an answer's first line no longer sits 25px below the top of its bubble. The Settings, Help row's questions wear the same chip.
- Files: a description or reading typed while the automatic one was still being written is no longer overwritten when the automatic one lands.
- Empty states: the Timeline's sits centred in its card instead of at the foot under a blank body, and the Graph's action button is its own width instead of spanning the map.
- Dashboard: an empty notebook no longer shows a strip of zeros above the welcome card; the figures appear with the first note or reminder.
- The loading screen shows one progress indicator (the bar) instead of animated dots above a bar; the dots stay as the screen reader's loading status.
- Ctrl+D opens today's note from any tab, or starts it in the composer with
  the day as its title when the day has none (a document titled with the day
  counts too). It is in the shortcuts list and can be rebound. On an open
  board Ctrl+D still duplicates the selection, and inside the documents editor
  it still selects the next match.
- Settings, Models says what the built-in search engine costs in memory
  (about 650 MB while the app is open, measured) and that choosing Ollama for
- A dropdown's list opens under its own box, left edges aligned, and only hangs from the right edge when it would otherwise run past its container (the Corner companion list opened out to the left over the Settings nav).
  embeddings keeps MemoryMap itself near 100 MB. Measured with the imports at
  startup, which were already lazy: nothing heavier than FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
  and alembic loads before the embedding model does.
- Dragging a note that is part of a lasso selection on the graph carries the
- Library: coming back to the tab no longer rebuilds every card when nothing has changed (0 DOM changes over three revisits, from 189).
- Library images and files: the search box rebuilds the grid once when typing pauses instead of on every keystroke.
  whole selection with it, at the same offsets. Before, only the note in hand
  moved and the rest of the selection stayed put. The usual rules hold for
- Settings rows keep their control at the end of the row and wrap the description instead (Corner companion put its select on a line of its own).
- Dashboard: the Full view is back to how it was (the owner: it looked too close to Compact, and the Jump to buttons wrapped inside the toolbar row).
  every note carried: a plain drag places, Shift pins, and a pinned note stays
  pinned where it lands.
- Quit from the desktop window closes the window at once; the background cleanup (up to 5s for a scheduler mid-write) now finishes behind it rather than in front of a window that looks frozen.
- Settings, What it learned can delete or reset several rows at once: tick
  them and the selection bar offers Delete, and Reset when a ticked row was
  edited by you. One request changes them all or none, and each deletion is
  still remembered so the next run does not derive it again.
- A Recent activity widget for the dashboard, in the widget picker: what
- The note composer: its placeholder's second and third lines no longer start with a stray indent, and the Highlight, Remove highlight and Link buttons are flat like the rest of the toolbar instead of looking pressed.
  changed in the notebook lately (notes, documents, boards and reminders),
  and whether you, Atlas or a skill changed it. Off until added, so no
- Confirm dialogs set their question as a title above the consequence ("Quit MemoryMap?" over "The app and its server will stop").
- Filled danger buttons and red count badges use a text colour chosen for their ground: in the dark theme the Quit, Delete and Empty bin buttons were white text on a light red (2.2:1), now dark text on it.
- Graph: the minimap panel is opaque (node labels printed through it), with the fade on the map inside it instead.
- Timeline rows show a wiki link's words instead of its raw [[brackets]] (the one list that printed markup).
- Note cards show their first three links and a "+N more links" button for the rest, instead of every link chip at once.
  existing dashboard grows a widget. It reads the event log's newest rows
  once and then only what came after, with no timer running while the tab
  sits idle.
- Quit MemoryMap works again from the desktop window: the in-app Quit now closes the window and ends the process the way the tray's Quit does; it used to send an interrupt signal that never reached a window's event loop, so the dialog closed and the app stayed open.
- Settings, Tools it can use: the tool list is a two-column grid with each description clamped to two lines (the rest on hover), so the section is 4,026px at 1440 instead of 6,901px.
- The document editor's dock starts with a "Documents" breadcrumb back to the Library's Documents list, since the editor has no tab of its own.

### Fixed

- A menu opened while a scroll is still settling (a right-click during a trackpad's momentum, a smooth scroll) no longer closes itself a moment later: the scroll that closed it had started before it opened.
- The avatar lab opens without the three inline-style warnings the app's content policy logged (its three style attributes are classes now).
- The corner companion's size handle shows only while the pointer is over it, it has the keyboard's focus or it is being sized, never at rest and not while it is carried (round 4).
- The corner companion's menu opens at the pointer when you right-click or hold it, and beside it from the keyboard; a walk or a poof under way stops where it is when the menu opens, so the menu is never left behind (it had been, 38 to 142px away, when the companion was clicked while moving) (INBOX 426 x, 84.png).
- Stay here on every page means it: a companion pinned away from the window's edges keeps its place when the window is resized or the app opens at another size (it jumped by the whole change in size, 200px for a 900 to 700px window), one pinned by the bottom bar or a corner keeps its distance from that edge, and pinning it while it walks pins it where it is, not where it was going (INBOX 426 l).
- Your look's Holding picker no longer shows empty: a face saved before a part was taken out (the rude gesture) is read without it, on this computer and by the server, so the picker reads From your name and the rest of the look is kept. A double-click on your profile picture, in the profile or the Settings head, opens it large as the companion's does (INBOX 426 w).
- The corner companion's menu stays at it: nothing the companion does on its own moves it while its menu is open (it used to wander 338px off and leave the menu behind), and a panel that carries it carries the menu; the menu still flips to its left at the right edge and stays inside the window, measured at four sizes and scales, by right-click and by Shift+F10 (INBOX 426 x).
- The corner companion leaves with its panel like the page does: on a panel in a scroll area it rides that area's scroll (the browser moves it, however fast you scroll) and is clipped with it, is still there when the panel comes back, and only goes elsewhere on its own beat once the page is still. A jump it must make (out of sight, or too far to walk) is a star-burst poof, 370ms. Choosing a perch went from 176ms to 6ms (INBOX 426 x).
- The corner companion is far lighter on the page: no filter on its moving figure, its drawing's idle motion paced at twenty steps a second and held while you scroll, and no obstacle sweep per scroll step. Atlas idle went from +190ms to +63ms a second of main thread, and the companion's scripting while scrolling from +0.46ms to +0.06ms a frame (INBOX 426 x).
- The corner companion stays on a panel that moves by a transform (a card sliding, a dock easing open) every frame for as long as it animates, rather than catching up a beat later; it was 32px adrift over a 2.4s slide, now under 1px (INBOX 426).
- The companion rides with the panel it is on: a scroll or a moving panel carries it in the same frame (0px off its panel over a measured scroll, it used to stay put 240px away), a panel that leaves the view is let go at the edge and it walks to the nearest free perch once the page is still, a tab switch only asks for a look on its own beat, nothing fades it out and in elsewhere, Stay here on every page never moves on its own, Call back (its menu, Appearance, the command palette) brings it back from anywhere, its menu opens beside it, and a new profile name redraws it (INBOX 426 d, g, k, l, m, n, o, p).
- The companion's arms and held things are no longer cut off at the sides (each drawn part is framed with room for its outline), a hanging companion keeps hold of its prop, and the rude hand gesture is gone; a test checks every gesture a line names is drawn (INBOX 426 c, j, k).
- With the system's Reduce motion on, faces and the corner companion now keep moving slowly (every loop six to nine seconds) instead of freezing mid-frame; everything else still stops.
- The shared control height is declared at the root, so the 70 rules that read it no longer lose their height outside the four containers that used to declare it (the Reminders filter chips were 22px against 36px everywhere else).
- Library: flicking through the sub-tabs no longer rebuilds each one on every press; a section shown in the last few seconds is shown as it was, and the skill logs no longer blank to "Loading logs…" over a list already drawn (measured over eight quick switches: 16 fetches and 543 DOM changes before, 8 and 232 after).
- Accessibility: every text field that had only a placeholder now has a label a screen reader reads (the chat box, quick capture, magic add, server address, About me, persona and skill fields, custom CSS, the import path), and each reminder's done box names the reminder it completes.
- Settings, Help: one "Welcome and tours" group (Replay the welcome beside the tour buttons) and a "What each part does" heading over the topics, instead of a second "Help & guide" head, a lone button and a loose sentence.
- The "m" key guide is a compact panel: "Go to" and "Do" side by side as two lists, each row a name with its key at the right edge, and a head that says how to close it. The Write with AI popup in the editor has one height for the field and both buttons, even padding, and its hint line starts under the field. Profile links straight to the avatar rows in Appearance.
- Settings, Personas: the dashboard greeting's persona picker and its face are filled straight away instead of after the preferences load and the whole persona list (it showed an empty box with no face on a busy start). Wherever there is no persona to draw a face for, the animated app logo shows instead of an empty space.
- The model status poll no longer times out after a start: it answered by asking every installed model its capabilities in turn (up to 5s each, inside an 8s budget); it now answers from what it already knows and asks the rest in the background. A slow answer is logged as a warning, not an error.
- Settings: "Profile & preferences" is split into Profile (your name, look and About me, under Atlas) and General (recycle bin, chat history, answer style, search relevance, notifications, writing, first under Your notebook). Both save on their own; the heading that only linked to Web search is gone.
- Account & security lists its facts as a label column and a value column, and a missing creation date says "Unknown" instead of a stray ", ". Chat titles in the sidebar wrap to two lines with an ellipsis instead of being cut at the edge. The Reminders filter chips are the same height as every other filter chip. Import folder and Import from path are secondary buttons, so each import card has one filled action.
- Settings: the dialog is wider (the backend address was clipped) and its nav fits "Profile & preferences"; the model server line reads "isn't running" with the same dot as the search engine line instead of typed ●/○; the search engine heading loses its parenthetical; the leftover "Changes here save on their own" line is gone; file pickers across the app use the app's button style instead of the browser's grey "Choose Files" slab.
- The page's bottom inset matches its other three edges (16px at 1440 instead of 24px plus the last card's padding), so pages no longer end in an empty band above the status bar.
- Sheets (the per-feature model picker and every other bottom sheet) take a reading width on a desktop window instead of the whole screen, their rows start at the icon instead of centring, the state line sits under the title as a subtitle, and the model picker's first row says what it does ("Default (model)").
- Dashboard edit mode: the long hint sentence is now an "Editing layout" badge and three short gestures on one line, the bar no longer wraps onto two lines on a desktop window, and Done is the filled button while editing.
- Folded sidebars (Notes, Chat, Documents) show their name down the rail under the open button, with a faint accent wash, instead of an empty white column; the folded skill logs match them in width, button position and style.
- Dashboard, Focused view: the search field has its own full-width row again instead of sharing a line with the greeting (its width changed with the greeting's length), and the banner is a compact version of the Full one, with the time on the right.
- Shortened note text across the app (the dashboard's last-note pill, pickers, link labels, previews) is cut at a whole word with an ellipsis instead of mid-word.
- The Library counted only the newest 200 of each kind, so a notebook of 400 notes read "Notes 198" and a Library search could not find an older note. Counts are the real totals, a search asks the server (which matches before it pages), and a line under the grid says when only the newest page is shown.
- Saved looks in Appearance get room for their names (two lines before any truncation) and the delete button is a small badge on the card corner instead of crowding the name. The dashboard search field no longer lets the background art show through when glass is off.
- The companion showed on the lock screen; now only once unlocked. Regenerating the dashboard greeting said "Asking Atlas" whatever persona it was set to; it names the right one. A second change of the greeting persona did not redraw its face. Faces under 28px (chat bubble marks) no longer loop or follow the pointer, which was cost for no visible gain.
- Background art, Microbes costs about a quarter less a frame: each species' bodies are painted once into an atlas of headings and copied one per organism, and each glow is painted at the size it is drawn, both on whole pixels, where every outline used to be built, filled and stroked every frame and every glow scaled (2.2 to 2.4ms against 3.0 to 3.5ms a frame, median, in a software canvas at 1440x900).
- Background art, Mesh and Floating orbs are light on the whole machine now, not only on the page: both were CSS animations of large layers that the browser recomposited at the display's full rate, about a core of CPU (1,000ms a second against 150 with the art off, in software compositing). The mesh is now a fifth-density canvas at fifteen frames a second and the orbs a canvas that clears only each orb's own box: 360 to 410ms and about 500ms a second, 0.6 to 1.3ms and 1.3 to 1.5ms a frame. Still mode is a captured image for both, as for the other styles.
- Background art, Constellation costs about a third less a frame: star sprites are painted at the two sizes they are drawn and copied unscaled on whole pixels, the far layer's hundred tiny stars are four batched fills instead of a hundred image copies, and the links are hairlines without round caps (2.4 to 2.5ms against 3.5 to 4.1ms a frame, median, in a software canvas at 1440x900).
- Background art, Mycelium: colonies start from scattered spores, each sending out two to five threads at uneven angles that wake one by one, instead of a ring of even threads from one point; each generation's first strokes fade in, and a generation now fades out over about two seconds on its own canvas while the next grows on a second one, instead of the whole window dimming and then clearing at once.
- The corner companion: its speech bubble came out blank in some looks (text in a transparent colour), it sat on the back-to-top button, even after being dragged (it now measures the overlap with that button and the chat's jump pill wherever it is, and steps aside while they show), and dragging it was jerky (it now moves on the compositor once a frame, holding still while carried). It also showed you when set to the chat persona, and the dashboard mark set to the greeting persona kept the logo, whenever that persona was the default voice: both now show Atlas.
- Mind maps: the topic menu from the ring's More opens beside the More sector at any display scale and text size. On a page made narrow by Windows' display scaling (a 1256px window at 200% is a 628px page) neither side of More had room, and the menu was pushed over More itself; it now tries the side More faces, the other side, then below or above it, and scrolls when it fits nowhere whole. A placement correction that would move the menu out of the window is refused and logged.
- Inline maths, `$x^2$` on one line, now draws through the same TeX-to-MathML renderer the `$$ ... $$` blocks use, in notes, chat and documents Read view, instead of being reduced to a Unicode stand-in symbol (or, for a formula with no known symbol, left as literal source). A `$` pair only opens one when there is no space just inside either delimiter and the closing `$` is not immediately followed by a digit, so "$5 and $10" is still two prices.
- The OCR workspace's message for a reading with no page positions (a vision reading, or a file's own extracted text) said "Install Tesseract" even when Tesseract was already on the machine and simply was not the chosen reader, the common case since the vision model is the default. It now says so only when Tesseract is actually missing; otherwise it says to switch the reader to it.
- A stored reading with a degenerate loop in it ("Test, Test, Test, ...") from before this app started cutting loops out of a fresh reading, or from a model that still manages one, stayed looped forever: nothing re-read an already-stored reading on its own. A "Clean up repeated lines" broom button beside Delete reading, in both the OCR workspace and the lightbox's other-readings list, now runs the same cut on the stored text and repaints.
- Server mode used to sit for a few extra seconds after "Finished server process" was already logged, before actually quitting. Almost every route here is a plain `def`, so Starlette runs it through anyio's own thread pool, and a worker thread anyio leaves warm is not a daemon thread; Python's interpreter shutdown joins it with no timeout before the process can exit. The server now asks any such thread still alive to stop right after `uvicorn.run()` returns, bounded to one second, instead of waiting on whatever anyio's own idle timeout happens to be.
- Performance, notes: typing in the capture box no longer measures and resizes the hidden copy of its text on every keystroke (autogrow work over a 50-character run at 4x CPU: 492ms to 16ms), and a tab switch only resizes the text boxes whose content, width or font changed while they were out of sight (INBOX 424h, 424i).
- Performance, lightbox: stepping to the next or previous picture no longer forces a layout to scroll a stage that is already at its start. Five presses at 4x CPU: 457ms of work to 37ms (INBOX 424f).
- Performance, mind maps: expanding a folded branch brings back the topics it had instead of building each one again. Expanding the root of a 120-topic map at 4x CPU: the longest stall went from about 1,000ms to about 520ms (INBOX 424e).
- Performance, graph: coming back to the Graph tab no longer re-settles a map that had already come to rest (it opens at rest and framed, and any change to what is shown or to the forces still lays it out again); measured at 4x CPU on a 400-note graph, the main-thread work in the 12 seconds after a revisit went from 6,746ms to 1,382ms. Zooming no longer re-measures every label on every frame (165ms of text measuring per 16 wheel steps to none) (INBOX 424c, 424d).
- Performance, graph: the minimap is repainted at most once a frame while the layout moves, reuses its dots and lines instead of rebuilding them, and is not painted at all while it is switched off, the Graph tab is hidden or the window is minimised. Dragging a node on a 400-note graph at 4x CPU: minimap cost 1,502ms to 514ms (INBOX 424b).
- Performance, board: dragging a group of twenty on a 250-object board no longer searches the whole page for every item on every move; the selection bar is placed once a frame. Measured at 4x CPU, the drag handler went from 5,167ms to 167ms over forty moves and the longest stall from 901ms to 213ms (INBOX 424a).
- Performance, measured on a 400-note fixture at 4x CPU: typing in a long document no longer rebuilds the outline on every pause (515ms to 12ms per burst); the avatars' eyes no longer query the whole page on every pointer move (279ms to 20ms per 60 moves); the Library's image poll stops when you leave the Library (it kept fetching every 6s on other tabs). The sidebar's collapse button has a name screen readers can read (INBOX 424).
- The corner companion: its speech bubble came out blank in some looks (text in a transparent colour), it sat on the back-to-top button (it now steps left of it while the button shows), and dragging it was jerky (it now moves on the compositor once a frame, holding still while carried). It also showed you when set to the chat persona, and the dashboard mark set to the greeting persona kept the logo, whenever that persona was the default voice: both now show Atlas.
- Opening the Agent activity panel no longer shrinks the page under it. On the Graph and the Timeline the card lost 18rem the moment the panel opened (the graph card went from 767px to 479px tall at 1440x900, leaving empty page below it), and the boards list grew 40px past the bottom of the Library. The panel floats over every tab now; the scroll room it adds goes only to the lists that scroll (Dashboard, Reminders, the Notes list, the Library and Documents lists, the Timeline feed).
- Documents: the spelling menu could open at the top of the window, or not at all, when the click that opened it made the editor redraw the line (a right-click, a long-press, a double-click on a word in a line with formatting). It is placed from the word itself now, follows it when the line shifts, and a "/" typed near the bottom of the editor no longer closes its own menu by scrolling.
- Documents: an embedded document said "Nothing called ... yet" in Read view while Live view showed it; Ctrl+/ in a note wrote `<!--  -->` instead of opening the blocks menu.
- Mind map ring: the ring has a visible edge. A thin line round its outside and round the hole marks where it is against the board (3.8:1 in light, 5.1:1 in dark; it was 1.4:1 and 1.6:1), and the dividers between its actions stay hairlines.
- Library, Boards and maps: Map from notes works again with no model running. It was disabled with the AI-only controls, but it proposes an outline from how your notes are filed when no model answers, and says so.
- Mind map ring: every action's icon and word sits in the middle of its sector with at least 10px to both edges and both dividers ("Add beside" and "Cross-link" were 1.4px from both edges); the ring is as thick as its longest word needs.
- Mind map ring, More: its menu opens beside the More sector wherever the ring was when you pressed it, even if the board re-renders before the click; it can no longer open in the window's top-left corner, and says so in the console if anything tries. Focusing a sector no longer scrolls the board, which also closed the menu Enter had just opened.
- Graph, Trace: the strip ends in an X that leaves trace mode (Escape too). Its old Done only cleared the two ends.
- Lightbox: the zoom, Fit, Save and menu buttons read clearly in the light theme (they looked disabled on the dark backdrop, from every place a picture opens).
- Picture readings: a model stuck repeating itself ("Test, Test, Test, ...") is cut to one copy before the reading is stored, and a reading is capped in length. Each reading in the lightbox can be deleted, and the OCR workspace shows the same readings the lightbox does: the vision model's even when Tesseract is not the chosen reader, and the other one beside it, labelled, with its own delete.
- Tools and features, the command palette and Find anything's actions land on what they name: Suggested links opens the map's options and runs Suggest links, Export a board opens the export dialog, Theme opens Appearance with the theme control ringed, an AI tool opens its own row in Settings, a widget row shows its widget (or its row in the widget picker when it is off), and a document or board feature opens the newest one first. Before, 50 of the 110 written rows only switched tab, 11 more opened a Settings pane at its top, and the palette's Board overview and Find a card did nothing unless a board was open. A Settings deep link now rings its row (it rang only Search relevance before).
- View toggles (Notes rows/cards, Library list/cards): only the chosen half is
  filled; the other rests clear.
- The OCR workspace's Delete reading works again (it threw after the confirm).
- A callout's label in the document live view shows its icon, not "ph:warning".
- Mind map: the topic and line rings are pie menus: one ring cut into sectors with hairline dividers, each action's icon and word inside its sector, the hovered or focused sector filled, and the topic whole inside the hole (the board pans with a ring slid in from an edge). The arrows walk the sectors, Enter runs one, Escape closes. More opens its menu beside the More sector, and never in the window's corner.
- Whiteboard: with the Text or Sticky tool, a press-drag draws the box at the dragged size (a dashed preview while dragging, Shift for a square, a minimum of one line) and opens it for typing; a click still places the default size, and one undo takes a drawn box away.
- Whiteboard and mind map: panning with the middle button follows the pointer. A pressed wheel's own wheel events no longer move the board mid-drag (they pushed it 3300 to 3600px sideways over a 300px drag), and a middle press on a topic or a card pans instead of dragging the item (it moved the board 0px of 200).
- The installed Windows app keeps its launch log and window cache beside your
  notes in `%APPDATA%\MemoryMap AI`, not in a `data` folder wherever Windows
  started it, and the Start Menu's "Repair MemoryMap AI" now clears the cache
  the window really uses (it cleared an empty folder before).
- The installed Windows app knows time zones: the build now carries the zone
  database Windows lacks, so your zone is saved and "today" is your day.
- Settings' Restart relaunches the installed Windows app instead of closing it
  for good, and Remove on an optional package deletes it from the app's own
  folder (it used to run against your own Python and leave the package).
- Optional packages on the installed app find Python installed the usual way
  from python.org (the `py` launcher), and no longer mistake the Microsoft
  Store's placeholder `python.exe` for one.
- Import documents installs markitdown's PDF, Word and slides readers; bare
  markitdown reads none of the three.
- An app update run from Settings > About no longer starts the optional
  packages download inside the installer, and accepts the download host GitHub
  is moving release files to; the installer's packages page starts unticked,
  and says why, when Python is not on the computer.
- The desktop window opens on a free port when another program holds 8000,
  instead of showing that program's page; the About panel's release notes are
  in the packaged app; scripts are served as JavaScript even where the Windows
  registry says otherwise; the installer refuses 32-bit Windows, which cannot
  run the 64-bit app.
- The Windows installer's Documents box also installs scanned-PDF reading and
  Word export (one box, the page has no room for more).
- The selection bar's "Rewrite this with AI" opens its bar again: the press that
  opened it also counted as a click away and closed it at once.
- The Guide keeps the utility model when smart routing is off (the switch
  moves background jobs only). On a phone, toasts sit above the bottom tab bar,
  except on Chat, where the composer is.
- The attachment gallery answers a page of 200 rather than 1,000 by default,
  and every reader of it (the Library's Files and Images, the pickers, the
  editor's file list) reads to the end page by page, so a large notebook's
  files are neither cut off nor sent in one response.
- Download .md on a note card and on the Library's note and document cards
  saves the file on a notebook with a password; it opened a tab reading
  "Locked: unlock first", because a new tab sends no sign-in token.
- The dashboard's Most used widget says, in the widget picker, that it lists
  the notes you open and ask about most; it promised categories and tags,
  which is the Top tags widget.
- An OpenAI-compatible backend with nothing listening at its address is
  reported as not running, rather than as running with no models, so every
  control that needs a model is disabled before it is pressed instead of
  failing after.
- An OpenAI-compatible server that streams tool calls without an `index`
  field (OpenAI always sends one; some local servers do not) no longer folds
  every call into one and loses them all: a fragment that opens a call opens
  the next bucket and a nameless one continues the last, so an omitted index
  degrades to arrival order rather than to a collision.
- A question reopened from Ask history keeps its numbered records and no longer
  repeats them in a Sources box; the records column's facts have a word's gap.
- The skill logs fold to a rail beside the skills and remember it.
- Find anything's kind row fades only on an edge with more behind it, and the
  kinds rest as plain text with only the chosen one filled.
- Code documents: the selection bar offers only Ask Atlas and Rewrite (no markdown
  formatting over code), and every indentation step is drawn 2em wide, whatever
  the file's unit.
- A new chat could stutter up and down after a hint above the composer closed:
  the welcome's fit no longer toggles its own class to measure, and the
  transcript keeps its scrollbar's room.
- The Guide: the question after a long answer, and the fifth question of any conversation, failed with "Something went wrong asking that" (the route refused a history turn over 1,000 characters and more than six turns, and the panel sends its whole transcript); a listed answer is no longer cut off mid-list; and the shortcuts answer taught "g then a letter" for the tab chord, which has been "m" for months.
- The AI assistant's Edit, Write and Remove choice uses the same quiet selected
  state as every other choice control in the flat looks; the board export's
  format and scope are option tiles instead of a wrapping strip.
- Boards and maps: a drag-selection rectangle keeps up with the pointer on a big board or map. It is drawn on a canvas once a frame instead of rewriting the page each move, and letting go restyles only the items whose selection changed.
- Lightbox: the picture never runs under the previous and next arrows, at Fit or zoomed, at any width, and the information card under it is one width on every picture, edge to edge with the toolbar.
- Boards and maps: a picture exported (to a file or to the Library) is painted in the colours on screen, in light and dark: map topics, note cards and text boxes take their own fill, edge and ink, and a branch keeps its colour. In dark mode the topics used to come out white and the text dark on dark.
- Library and lightbox: a picture exported from a board or map carries the description the app wrote for it as "Written by MemoryMap", not "typed by hand", and a vision model that later describes it is credited alone rather than as an edit.
- Mind maps: a topic dropped on another topic, or joined to one by a line, is laid out as that topic's child with its own branch beside it, on a Free map as well as a tidied one, and one Undo puts the parent and every place back. It used to land on top of its new parent.
- Mind maps: the ring of actions on a topic or a line holds its buttons inside its band. Each is a small tile, icon over word, evenly spaced round the circle, and the band is sized to the tiles, so none hangs over its edge or into its hole at any width.
- The guide answers "Can Atlas write for me?" from a new Write with Atlas topic.
- Answer citations: a note the answer names by number ("Notes 1, 5, and 6")
  is marked, and a run of sentences from the same notes in one paragraph
  carries one mark at its end instead of one per sentence.
- With no model server answering, the chat's model picker says "(not connected)"
  after the inherited model instead of naming it as if it would run.
- A new chat no longer opens on a scrollbar: the suggested questions take the
  pane's width, the welcome tightens on a short window, phone starters scroll
  sideways, and "Jump to latest" stays hidden until there are messages.
- A chat answer's source cards read from the top (they centred their content,
  so cards in a row started on different lines), keep the kind at the foot,
  and no longer print a heading's `#` or repeat the title in the snippet.
- Settings, Preferences: the chat history row keeps its unit on one line
  (its note moved under it), units match their labels' size, and the answer
  style is a labelled row on the pane's grid.
- Chat: your messages are a quiet tinted bubble in the page's own ink, at
  the same size as Atlas's, rather than a bright accent block with a "You"
  header; the header says "No model connected" (and opens Settings) instead
  of naming a model that is not running; and "Jump to latest" and the
  back-to-top button hover to an opaque, visible state without flickering.
- Find anything: group headings are capitalised headings with their count
  ("Notes 15"), set a step below the results line; the kind chips count
  what the search found rather than everything indexed (they said "Notes
  46" beside 3 results); a snippet no longer prints a heading's `##`; and
  the chip row fades where more chips scroll.
- Menus, every one of them: the arrow keys work in every select, every dock
  menu and the board's menus, Escape closes the menu (not Settings around it)
  and gives the focus back to its button, and nothing opens with the focus
  lost. Section labels, selects and icons stand on one left edge; long menus
  (a note's, a chat's, a Library card's, Quick set) are grouped; Quick set
  opens beside its button; the Timeline's Options no longer has two
  sections called Show; the board's shapes open from the keyboard and its
  View menu scrolls instead of growing sideways on a short window or a phone.
- The dashboard's streak counts yesterday while today is still empty, like
  the journal, instead of saying 0.
- Contrast: the default look's dark muted and accent text, the warning chip
  and the dark danger buttons now reach 4.5:1 on their own grounds.
- Buttons: hovering a solid button deepens its colour instead of brightening it by 7% through a filter, which flickered on floating buttons in the desktop window; the tabs, the graph's zoom buttons and every icon button that had no hover of its own now answer the pointer (before: 101 of 571 buttons changed nothing but a filter). Every transition runs on the same three durations and curves, the switches' knob settles with a small spring, notifications fade in and out instead of popping, and the Library and Timeline show placeholder rows while their first page loads instead of a blank card.
- Speed with a large notebook (500 notes, 50 documents, 40 chats), measured by trace: switching to Notes restyles only the notes near the window (61ms to about 30), the Timeline builds its rows without making two date formatters per row (a 60 to 90ms switch now about 30), switching to Library no longer cross-fades the whole window after every data load (a 216 to 283ms pause gone), and the dashboard measures its widgets in one pass instead of one page layout per widget.
- A chip's x (detach a document, remove a file or a reference) is a round
  target the same distance from the chip's top, bottom and right edge, not
  a glyph with a stray gap after it.
- Settings, About counts notes the way the dashboard does: it said "96
  notes" for 44 notes, 2 drafts and 50 boards and maps, and its header's
  "46 entries loaded" is gone.
- The skill editor's Steps box is tall enough for its example and hint; the
  last line was cut in half.
- The guided tour can no longer leave the page dimmed with no card: a step
  that fails shows its card centred, a card off the window or behind
  something is re-centred, the page is kept from scrolling under it, and
  each case leaves a "Tour:" line in Settings, Logs.
- Boards: a concept map card's text is edited in the same editor as every other note box (live formatting, the "/" menu, Ctrl+B), with Enter to finish, Shift+Enter for a new line and Escape to discard; Tab in a card no longer jumps out of it.
- Documents: New from a template shows a preview of the page each template makes beside the list, on a window wide enough for two columns.
- Documents: the outline's rows take the app's 28px control floor under the comfortable and spacious densities and 44px on a touch screen; compact keeps the dense 25px list.
- Library, Boards & maps: a board or map card says when it last changed (the later of its own edit and the last thing drawn on it), like every other Library card.
- Fewer pills: the Library's kind row, the Boards filter, Reminders' Open/All/Done, the Write tab's starters and the dashboard's Jump to row are drawn with a button's corner; category, tag and fact chips with a small one; the dashboard's skill buttons lose their dashed edge; chips no longer rise on hover. On Ask, "Ask again" and "Try asking" questions are one style, a past question marked by a clock.
- Library, Boards & maps on a phone: the dock is two rows like every other Library dock (was four, 198px to 114px at 390); New mind map and Reload move into the dock's menu there and back out on a wider window.
- Segmented controls round their corners from one table: a choice control, a tab strip, a control inside a bar, the chat dock's pills and the one full-bleed strip; the OCR rail's Images, Files and Pages switch and the radio-backed toggles outside a bar now match the rest.
- Ask: every sentence the notes back gets its citation number in the answer, including sentences in a list, after a bold label or with a word in italics (a formatted answer grounded to three notes used to show none); the Matching records column is numbered as each sentence completes instead of after the answer finishes.
- A connection pill's ⋯ is round, so its hover no longer pokes past the
  pill's border, and a linked note whose first line is a heading or a
  clipped image reads as its words (no `#` or half an `![...`).
- Whiteboard and mind map: Escape during a selection rectangle or a lasso takes the drag back and keeps what was selected before it; the rest of the drag and its release select nothing.
- Whiteboard: a top-bar menu (Insert, Edit, Arrange, View, Board) that the window cannot hold opens under its button and scrolls there, instead of being drawn across the button and the top bar; Escape with a board menu open closes the menu and keeps the selection, so the context bar and its More stay where they were.
- Mind map: the More button on a topic's ring opens its menu right beside the button (on its left when the right has no room) instead of down and to the right of the whole ring.
- Mind map and whiteboard: panning no longer stalls on the press and the release (worst frame at 500 topics 166.6ms to 16.8ms): the grab cursor moved off the board's container, whose cursor every item inherited, and a Settings rule that made any class change anywhere restyle a whole subtree was narrowed. Cards, text boxes and topics well off screen are no longer drawn, and a dragged branch's lines stay on their topics every frame instead of trailing up to 12px behind.
- A skill's facts line in Settings no longer starts a wrapped line with its
  separator dot.
- A reminder's time sits at the end of its row; with a mouse, its actions
  appear over the time on hover instead of holding an empty 193px gap. An
  overdue reminder keeps its amber edge without the amber frame as well.
- Settings section intros step down to sit under their headings (they were
  larger than the headings they describe).
- Resizing the window across the phone width no longer leaves the Timeline's
  previous view in the page: the rows counted twice (113 read as 226), which
  broke arrow-key walking, the pinned day head and Enter's detail.
- Timeline rows with a second line keep their kind mark and time on the
  title's line, rather than centred between the two lines.
- The graph options panel's four section heads share one style (they wore
  three), and the dashboard's day streak tile opens the Timeline instead of
  doing nothing.
- Labels that lost their capitals in Quiet keep their rank: a section label is small, bold and in ink over a muted description, and the Contents index's section names are headings with the Timeline's underline over rows one step smaller; a Files row's name is in ink and lines up with its facts.
- Scrolling and typing, traced and cut: the page scrollers and the editor scroll on the compositor (Notes scroll raster 2.7s to 0.25s, Library 1.0s to 0.2s, typing in a long document 3.2s to 0.24s over a 30-step scroll or 88 characters at 1184x760); a card's hover animation stands down while a list scrolls; the back-to-top check no longer matches every button in the app on every scroll frame (184ms to 12ms); the open-menu checks on every scroll event walk only the menus; typing in a document no longer restyles the whole editor per keystroke (style 1.65s to 0.35s) or rewrites 51 toolbar states; the Library search no longer cross-fades the window on every letter.
- Dashboard: Quick capture saves on Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter), and its placeholder says so.
- Reminders: Enter adds a reminder from its text field, and in the edit form Enter saves and Escape cancels.
- Settings: Ctrl+F searches Settings while it is open (it used to search the page hidden behind it), and the arrow keys, Home and End walk the pane list.
- Settings: Packages no longer shows its heading twice.
- Dashboard widgets: a map in Boards & maps reads as a title like a board beside it (not an accent pill), the heatmap legend shows its swatches, and a reminder shows its time on a line of its own.
- Settings: a pane's title no longer sits flush on its first group, and a checkbox row keeps a gap from the field above it (found by a sweep for flush-stacked controls across every tab and pane).
- Documents: opening a markdown document right after typing in a code file no longer throws a stale completion error.
- A plain toast can be dismissed by tapping its text, as well as by its close button.
- A confirmation's button names its action ("Delete", "Remove", "Clear"...) read from the question, instead of a red "OK".
- Reminders: a reminder's row keeps its two snoozes and Edit, and gains a menu with Open its note, Ask Atlas about this, Copy text and Delete (still undoable), in place of a fourth icon.
- Lists keep the conventions people expect: a right-click (a hold on a phone) on a Library card, a Documents row, a link, a file, a note or a chat opens that row's own menu at the pointer; F2 renames the focused row; the arrow keys, Home and End move between cards and rows; Shift+click ticks the run between two; with a selection open, Escape clears it, Ctrl+A selects every row instead of the page's text, and Delete presses the bar's own Delete; the Library keeps its scroll position when you come back from another tab; an empty Library search offers Clear the search; Library cards and document rows gain Copy title (and Copy link for a document); New note, New document, New chat, Settings and light/dark name their shortcut in the tooltip.
- Library on a phone: the Files and Images dock is two rows instead of three (sort and view fold into a menu, as on the other sub-tabs), the floating Create shows only on the All view where it belongs instead of beside each sub-tab's own filled action, and New mind map keeps its icon without its word below 600.
- Library, second pass continued: skill cards title at card size (the eyebrow rule had set them at 12px), Built-in as a small label, Run as a ghost button so New skill is the one filled button, and the background workers as the settings switches; the skill log's Clear rests disabled with nothing to clear; the Contents index names a note by its heading, keeps its labels on one edge, and its jump chips lose the accent tint; chips that are still chips carry a hairline edge in the flat looks so they read on a white card; a failed thumbnail (dashboard, Contents, chat sources, timeline) is hidden instead of drawing the missing-image box in its slot; timeline rows show the category with its colour dot and tags as #tag, and leave Uncategorised out.
- With glass on, the status bar is glass like the top bar instead of an opaque strip.
- Resizing or turning a group of selected items is one undo step (Ctrl+Z put nothing back before), and Escape during it puts every member back.
- The board's help, the map rail's help, the rotate and resize grips and the map's canvas menu now name the new gestures and keys (Alt-drag, Shift to constrain, Escape to take back a drag, double-click a grip or a line, Ctrl+0 and Shift+1), so they can be found without being told.
- On a touch screen the Library card ticks and the reminder ticks keep their 44px target but draw a 22px box in the middle of it, instead of a bordered, shadowed 44px square beside every row at rest.
- The keyboard hint strip no longer stands over the bottom of every new mind map (it counted note cards, which a map has none of): a map's selected topic already names the keys on its ring and the rail's ? lists them, and on a whiteboard the strip shows only while a single note card is selected, the only time Tab and Enter act, and never over that card.
- The board and mind map View menu: groups are told apart by a hairline instead of a printed heading (DESIGN.md's menu rule), Zoom in and Zoom out leave it (the zoom bar has both), Zoom to 100% and the keys for it and for Fit join it, the Toolbar row moves in with the panels, the columns break before Panels so no rule sits at the head of a column, and a whiteboard no longer shows an empty "Map" group: 453px to 357px on a map at 1440.
- Lock screen: a real title, the password field at body size and the Unlock button as wide as the field.
- Notifications: the panel is wide enough for its activity picker, and in the flat looks an unread row is marked with a dot instead of a coloured left edge; the palette no longer paints a hovered row like the chosen one.
- Find anything: the text-selection menu no longer appears over the Finder (a search field's selected query is not writing; fields inside overlays are excluded); result rows lose the button glow, titles step to 500, dates read "Sep 23", a zero-count kind is dimmed, the dialog's name is its heading and Sort matches the chips. In the flat looks no button carries the accent glow.
- Settings: every pane opens with its name as a heading (eleven of eighteen began mid-thought), a list row's actions sit on its title line instead of leaving an empty band under it, and labels straight in a pane line up with their text.
- Settings: every section help "?" sits on one right edge (five positions before) with no filled ground in the flat looks; a pane's title is a real heading flush with its text; skills, personas and templates show a title, a hairline Built-in label, dot-separated facts and "Changes notes" in the warn colour instead of rows of identical pills; a persona's voice is clamped to two lines instead of cut mid-word.
- The guided tour is back on, and every door into it works again. It was broken whenever anything was open over the page (the Atlas guide, the command palette, the features browser, the shortcut sheet): each step lit up the overlay instead of the control. The tour now closes what is open before every step and checks that nothing is drawn over the control it points at. On a phone the card is a sheet at the top or bottom of the screen, Settings and Timeline point at More with words that say so, and the step count no longer changes half way through. Typing in the highlighted box types instead of moving the tour.
- Graph: the Documents switch now shows every live document (unattached ones alone, hidden by Hide unlinked like any lone node) instead of only documents attached to notes, which left the switch doing nothing on most notebooks; the options panel's folds are inset from the edge and the Groups field matches its Add button's height.
- Board and mind map conventions, second pass: a board's bare canvas answers a right-click with its own menu (paste here, a text box, a sticky, select all, zoom to 100%, fit) and a double-click with a text box ready to type; Ctrl+0, Ctrl+=, Ctrl+- and Shift+1 work the board's zoom, and the zoom buttons name them; a double-click on a mind map's branch line asks for its label instead of making a new topic on top of it.
- Board and mind map conventions, first pass: double-click a rotate grip stands a card, text box or shape upright again; Shift on a corner keeps the box's proportions (it squared it); Shift keeps a drag on one axis; Alt-drag leaves a copy behind; Escape during a move, resize, turn or link draw puts everything back and records nothing; a burst of arrow nudges is one undo step and no longer drops presses; a group drag undoes whole; Ctrl+D, copy and paste take several items at once and paste at the pointer; a click on a shape's grip no longer deselects it; Ctrl+Shift+G on a board ungroups without also switching agent mode on.
- Library, second pass: cards read left to right in the order the sort promises (they were dealt top to bottom one column at a time, so every tag landed in the last column); a note card no longer repeats its first line as its preview, and a document row no longer repeats its title; "Uncategorised" is left off card feet and a real category shows with its colour dot; a card's picture fills the card's top edge; a board card's icon leads its title; a file's first-page thumbnail that fails no longer draws "Image no longer in this notebook" inside the tile; the tick on Documents, Links and Files rows takes the kind mark's place under the pointer instead of a 28px square on every row; the Links add form folds away behind Add link (Esc or Done closes it); row titles share one rank and a file's read state is a fact, not a pill.
- Note meta line, second pass: the category is a soft pill with its own stable colour dot, tags read #work, a date reads as the day alone (the note's own phrase on hover), and each connection is one pill with its menu inside it, so hidden menus no longer leave gaps between connections; image markdown no longer shows raw in a connection's label. Settings no longer scrolls sideways at 768.
- De-vibecoding, settings: switch labels at 500 instead of bold, a healthy status is a green dot before muted text instead of a green sentence, section help is a bare glyph in the flat looks, number fields share one short width, and the name placeholders no longer carry a real person's name.
- De-vibecoding, reminders: the due readout is a small muted note on the form, and a reminder's own words are body size instead of 12px.
- De-vibecoding, timeline: row titles at 500 and the category as muted text, instead of a column of bold accent pills.
- De-vibecoding, dashboard, chat and graph: sentence-case labels in Quiet, plain stat icons, no eyebrow over the greeting, an even 16px rhythm, the name nudge as inline text; card titles at 600 (650 rendered as bold on static fonts); chat suggestions read as questions, not accent pills; the thread mark and the graph legend lose their extra frames.
- De-vibecoding, Notes and Library: a note's facts are one quiet line (category with a dot, #tags, space, links, date) instead of five pills, and confident AI filing moves to the category's tooltip; in the flat looks a selected tab, segment or filter chip is a neutral ground so the accent marks only actions; the Library hides empty kinds, shows a card's tick on hover (always on touch), drops the per-kind colour stripe in the flat looks, and titles step down to 600; the notes filter placeholder no longer truncates.
- The "No model is connected" notices keep a gap below their button, so the draft chips and the agent's description no longer sit flush against it.
- A cross-link on a mind map is drawn like the map's own branches: the same ribbon or line style, facing anchors, weight and taper, in its branch's colour, instead of a straight pen-coloured line.
- With glass on, the graph's floating dock and panels and the chat composer are frosted panes like the rest of the glass chrome, instead of an opaque bar and a near-black well.
- The full test suite runs across every core (pytest-xdist): under 9 minutes on four cores instead of about 25. The resurface timing test now waits for the embedding warm-up before it starts its clock.
- Quiet utilitarian no longer sets compact density, which had squeezed every spacing token app-wide, and the dashboard's Full view has its labelled rows, two-line hints and larger clock back, so Full and Compact differ again (first widget at 631px against 483px at 1440).
- On a phone the foot of the screen is one bar, not two: Back, Undo and the
  AI status sit in the top bar, and the status bar's other controls are in
  the top bar's menu. The status bar comes back only while a job is running,
  or when offline or on power saver.
- On a phone a note row is the note: no action buttons sitting on its tags,
  no coloured strips at its edges, and the list runs the full width. Swipe
  to favourite or bin, tap to open, or use the row's menu.
- On a phone the Notes and Chat headers are one row (title and actions),
  with the search under it; the chat's model, skills, web search and plan
  are in the "How it answers" sheet behind the gear, so the controls under
  the chat box fit on one row and nothing is cut off.
- On a phone Reminders opens on the list; "New reminder" (the floating
  button, and a button in the list's header on a computer) opens the add
  form as a sheet, which closes once the reminder is added.
- On a phone every list header is one row of title and actions with the
  search under it, and the Library's cards start on the first screen: the
  header is unframed, the words-written line is left to the dashboard, and
  a card's preview is three lines.
- On a phone toasts and the agent activity panel no longer cover the tab
  bar (a toast also clears the floating button), and a long note shows five
  lines in the list rather than eight.
- A board's top bar menus keep an icon when their words are dropped on a
  narrow window, instead of five identical arrows; on a phone an open board
  takes the Library's sub-tabs' space, the map's keyboard hint is left to
  keyboards, and the tool bar at the foot has lost a stray dark frame.
- On a tablet, or any touch screen, every control is a finger's size
  (44px) at any width, not only below 820; the status bar is a touch bar
  there and no longer pushes the page sideways at 768; Reminders opens on
  its list below 1100; and the Library's kind chips stay on one row.
- On a phone every ⋯ menu opens as a sheet from the bottom of the screen,
  with full-width rows; Escape closes only the top sheet when one is open
  over another; and closing the sidebar sheet puts the focus back on the
  button that opened it.
- Tab in the documents editor leaves the caret after the indent it inserts;
  what you typed next used to land before it.
- JSX in a `.js` document is no longer underlined as a syntax error.
- Scrolling does less per frame everywhere: the back-to-top button updates once per frame and only writes what changed, the bar-over-list edge measures only when a list crosses its top, and the graph's wheel listener lives on the graph canvas instead of every tab.
- The packaged Windows app shows a splash from the moment it is opened, drawn
  by the launcher itself before Python starts, and closes it when the window
  appears. Not verified on a Windows build from this sandbox.
- Optional packages installed from the packaged app, or ticked in the
  installer, now actually load: they go into a folder beside your notes that
  the packaged app reads. Needs a Python on PATH to run pip, as before.
- Editing a note right after starting the app no longer blanks the notes list.
- The note count is the same everywhere (drafts are left out, as the list
  already did).
- Select all (and Select none) in every selection bar; the Timeline's only
  ticks notes and boards, the rows its actions can act on.
- Clicking into a table cell in the documents live view puts the caret where
  you clicked.
- Undo covers text formatting, colours and every mind map style change.
- The Notes toolbar stays on one line in the desktop window; the dashboard's
  Start tiles fit one row there, and never wrap in compact view.
- On a mind map the bottom bar offers one Cross-link tool drawn in the map's
  own line style, instead of a generic straight and curved pair; a map
  line's label drags with the pointer and no longer starts a selection box.
- The dashboard's note count leaves out boards and maps, as the Notes list
  does.
- Notes, documents, boards and maps can be taken straight to a chat with
  Atlas from their menus, and a note to the graph (centred and lit).
- Menus, docks, popovers and the graph toolbar follow the chosen look in
  every palette (they stayed navy in dark), the desktop loading page and the
  packaged splash wear the look too, and a new Background wash setting gives
  the flat looks a soft light across the page. Classic is second in the list.
- The mind map node menu is eight rows with Add, Topic, Branch and Order
  flyouts (was eighteen rows, most of the screen), and the topic's ring stays
  open beside it. A press inside any menu no longer closes it before a group
  can open. The dashboard's top is calmer: a lower hero with an ink clock,
  one-line start tiles, and Jump to as quiet pills beside their label.
- A dashboard you have not arranged shows nine widgets (reminders, recent
  notes, favourites, quick capture, documents, boards and maps, the weekly
  digest, on this day, the heatmap) instead of all twenty-three; the rest are
  under Widgets, and Reset returns here. Reminder times read as a day and a
  time, and the heatmap counts notes, not boards.
- The Back and Forward history names places ("Documents: Weekly plan",
  "Library: Documents") instead of internal ids.
- Model pickers show the short model name and stop at 14rem, and no longer
  call an installed model "not installed".
- Theme and palette cards in Appearance keep their text inside the card and
  line up: swatches and names on one line per row, descriptions in body weight.
- Links everywhere use the accent colour (plain links were the browser's own
  blue and purple); Timeline rows for boards and reminders no longer repeat
  their title as a snippet; an empty Ollama embedding picker says why.
- A note's connections are one chip and one ⋯ menu each (edit or clear the
  reason, remove the link), instead of three round buttons inside every chip.
- The chat header names the model that actually answers (on llama.cpp and
  LM Studio, the loaded one), or says a set model is not installed, instead
  of the configured default. A broken search by meaning now says so in a
  toast and the bell, with a Fix it button, not only inside Settings.
- A picture is described once and its text read once: repeat saves no
  longer queue repeat jobs, Tesseract stands down when a vision model reads
  the text, and a running caption shows as one row in Agent activity, not
  two.
- Panning and zooming the whiteboard and mind maps no longer re-styles every
  item on the board each frame (traced: 2.4 s of style work over a 50-step
  pan on a 60-topic map, now 29 ms; zoom 1.4 s to 18 ms). Worst frame at 50
  topics is one frame for pan, drag and zoom alike.
- Text boxes, sticky notes and mind map topics keep their line breaks when
  saved (they were joined into one line), and Tab / Shift+Tab indent lines
  in them. Note boxes indent with Tab from the first keystroke after a
  restart, not only once the editor has loaded. Renaming a topic can be
  undone.
- The note Capture box's formatting toolbar stays on one row in the desktop
  window: the two colour pickers are an icon and a caret, and on a narrow
  window List, Task and Preview show their icons only.
- A missing search-by-meaning package is reported in words, with
  nomic-embed-text offered as the alternative, instead of a traceback.

### Added

- Code documents act like a code editor: a syntax error is underlined with a
  mark beside its line and says what is wrong on hover (Python, TOML, XML
  and YAML checked by the app itself, JSON, JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS in
  the window, nothing sent anywhere), and a list of the language's keywords
  and the names already in the file appears as you type.
- Code documents close quotes and brackets as you type, with the caret
  between them: typing the closer steps over it, Backspace in an empty pair
  takes both, and a pair typed over a selection wraps it. Enter between
  braces opens an indented line with the closer below it, and a typed `}`
  lines up with its opener, in every code type including C, Java, Go, Rust
  and PHP.
- Format for code documents, from a Format button in the document's dock,
  Shift+Alt+F or the command palette: the selected lines, or the whole file
  when nothing is selected. It re-indents by the brackets (by the elements
  for HTML and XML), removes trailing spaces and ends the file with one line
  break, never touches the inside of a string, keeps every JSON number
  exactly as written, and refuses with the reason when the code does not
  parse. Python and YAML keep their indentation, which is their syntax. One
  Ctrl+Z undoes it.
- Quick fixes for code problems: hovering an underline offers its fix as a
  button, and Alt+Enter lists the fixes at the caret (with both formats
  beneath); F8 goes to the next problem. Fixes add a missing bracket or
  quote, change or remove a stray closer, close a comment, remove a JSON
  trailing comma, add a missing comma or quotes in JSON, add Python's
  missing colon, and convert mixed tabs and spaces. C, C++, C#, Java,
  Kotlin, Go, Rust, Swift, PHP, R and SQL documents are now checked for
  unbalanced brackets, strings and comments.

### Changed

- Controls share one shape: fields, dropdowns and buttons take the same corner, dialog and sheet titles sit on their close button's centre line, sidebar heads keep their title and action on one row, and a hovered settings row keeps its hint readable in both themes.
- Shadows in light mode are cast in the app's own ink rather than a violet tint; the Library's Create picker has a proper dialog head; the dashboard says "1 reminder"; chat starters no longer read "about about"; Library previews start on a whole word; hints in one-line boxes stay on one line.
- The corner companion reads along (or covers its eyes) however a note is opened: from search, a link, the command palette, the Library, the timeline, the graph or chat, not only from its row.
- What a face holds (a wand, a mug, sushi, a book, a thumbs up) shows in its head mark again, in a small raised hand at the lower right as the first faces drew it, not only on the companion; the small mark keeps its one cue (INBOX 426 f).
- The packaged app's startup splash is a still card without the progress bar it
  could never move; a status line under it says what is loading.
- A note's time sits in the same place on every card, its top-right corner
  on the title's line (it gives way to the note's buttons on hover); the
  dates a note's words mention read as one item ("Mentions 21 Sept, 25
  Sept") rather than calendar chips beside the time; the space is shown only
  when you have more than one; and a connection's menu button sits evenly
  inside its pill.
- The Guide knows much more and finds it more reliably. Fourteen new topics
  (search, links, security and passwords, troubleshooting, performance, the
  tour, personas, translation, templates, tags and categories, updates,
  notifications, code files, mind maps), the words people actually use
  added to every topic, and a ranked search that forgives a typo. On a bank
  of 122 real questions it reaches the right topic first 99% of the time
  (49% before), and with no model it answers with that one topic and names
  the related ones instead of pasting three together.
- A package check builds the frozen Windows app on every pull request that
  touches packaging, the entry point or index.html, and weekly, and fetches
  every script and stylesheet the page references plus each lazy bundle,
  so a file missing from the bundle fails before release day.
- The mind map layer (a map's nodes, edges, themes, tidy, the edit strip
  and the radial menus) moved out of whiteboard.js into whiteboard-map.js.
  Nothing it does changed; it still arrives with the Library, and
  whiteboard.js is about a quarter smaller (212 KB gzipped, was 292 KB).
- The document editor's code tools (checks, completions, Emmet, hover,
  symbols, sticky scroll, go to definition, Run, format and quick fixes)
  and its prose tools (grammar, suggestion mode, the accessibility check,
  read aloud) moved out of documents.js into documents-code.js and
  documents-prose.js. Nothing they do changed; they still arrive with the
  Library, and documents.js is about a quarter smaller (242 KB gzipped,
  was 314 KB).
- The Timeline tab's code moved out of app.js into its own file,
  timeline.js, loaded at startup right after the dashboard's. Nothing it
  does changed; app.js is about 24 KB smaller to download (gzipped), which
  brings it back under its size bound instead of raising the bound a third
  time.
- Atlas has a persona rather than a job title: "the librarian of this
  notebook: warm, curious and a little witty", who knows the notes well,
  likes spotting how they connect, speaks plainly and says so when the notes
  don't know. A persona of your own still replaces it.
- The m guide is one panel of key-and-label rows over a darker backdrop,
  rather than glowing pills over the page's own text, and its "Atlas" entry
  is called Guide, which is what it opens.
- Atlas has a little more personality: the default Friendly style is warm,
  a little curious and points out a link between notes when it spots one,
  and the empty chat greets you in Atlas's own voice. The grounding rules are
  unchanged, and a persona of your own replaces both.
- The flat looks' background wash has a soft accent light in the bottom right
  corner as well as the top left, as Classic does.
- Capture's "Add to this note" tools (Attach, From library, Sketch, Dictate,
  Improve) and "Add to document" are a quiet toolbar rather than a row of
  heavy buttons, with Improve set apart; every Capture row shares one label
  column, and on a phone the labels sit above their fields.
- **A new default look, Quiet utilitarian**: a warm grey ground, solid
  panels, one ink-blue accent and tighter spacing. Two new looks, Editorial
  paper and Technical mono, sit beside it in Appearance, and the previous
  look is kept as Classic. A look you already chose is kept.
- The documents live view reads as a page: the text sits in a measure of about
  75 characters with a margin either side, and the space between blocks comes
  from one scale (more above a section, less under its heading, one gap
  however many blank lines were typed).
- Tables in the documents live view mark the cell you are editing, have the
  rendered view's cell spacing, keep their menu clear of the last heading,
  and a new row from Tab puts the caret where you would type. Code blocks
  have an inset, and quotations have a visible bar in both the live and the
  rendered view.
- The documents live view draws more of markdown: indent guides under
  nested lists, finished tasks struck through (in the rendered view too),
  bare web addresses and `<address>` links as links, and a backslash escape
  without its backslash until you are on the line.
- The mind map node menu is grouped with dividers instead of hover
  submenus, so it works by touch and keyboard. Clearing a line's label
  prompt no longer deletes it; "Take the label off the line" does.
- "Advanced response settings" in Settings, Models lines up with every other
  heading. Its disclosure arrow pushed it 20.8px to the right; the arrow now
  hangs in the margin beside the heading instead of being removed.
- On a phone, the '?' beside "Tools this skill may use" in Settings, Skills
  can be pressed again. The fold's heading wrapped onto two lines inside a
  box pinned to one line's height, which left the '?' outside the box it
  belonged to; a fold heading now grows with its words. Found by a new sweep,
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/help-popovers.js`, which opens every '?' in Settings
  at 1440 and 390 and checks each one lands inside the window (82 of 82).
- Reminder alerts no longer miss a reminder that is due when the notebook
  holds many finished ones. The minute-by-minute check read one page of
  reminders ordered oldest first with the ticked-off ones included, so the
  page could be all done reminders; it now asks for open ones only, soonest
  first. And two requests the app made twice at every start (recent
  questions and most-used notes, once for the Notes tab and once for the
  dashboard) are made once, because a request already in flight is now
  shared by whoever asks for the same thing (measured with
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/oi-dupfetch.js`: 6 boot requests to 4).
- Similar-notes lists can no longer contain a note that was deleted or made
  private in the same session. Its vector was blanked in place, and a blank
  row outranked every genuinely unrelated note, so a short list could come
  back with a hole in it; blanked rows are now skipped, and dropped from
  memory once they are a quarter of the total.
- A reopened chat or Ask history answer keeps its "Only 1 of 3 sentences here
  comes from your notes" line. The line appeared when an answer arrived and
  was gone once the conversation was reopened, because nothing stored it; the
  saved turn now carries it, counted on the server by the same rule the live
  answer used.
- "Rebuild search index" in Settings, Models rebuilds the word index as well
  as the semantic one. The word index was built once, when its table was
  first made, and could not be rebuilt after a restore, an import or a fault;
  `/search/stats` now also says when it was last rebuilt and with how many
  rows.
- `has:image`, `has:link` and `has:reminder` work in Find anything. They were
  understood and matched nothing; now a picture attached or written into the
  text, a connection to another note, and a reminder on the note each answer,
  checked over the matches rather than on every save.
- Search no longer finds things that are gone. Emptying the bin left each
  purged note in the search index for good (it still answered `is:deleted`),
  and deleting a space left its notes, documents and reminders findable from
  All spaces, because both delete in bulk and the index only follows ordinary
  saves. Both now take their rows out, and a lint fails any new bulk delete
  of a searchable kind that does not.
- A note the AI re-files, by adding context to it or by re-evaluating it, is
  marked as the AI's choice, the same as a note it files on save. Moving one
  of those by hand afterwards now records the correction the filing loop
  learns from; before, only the two create paths set the mark, so a second
  guess by the AI was invisible to it.
- Settings, Models says which model background jobs actually run on, and why
  (INBOX 277). The utility picker shows the stored choice, and that choice is
  not the model in use while smart model routing is off or nothing has been
  chosen; a line under it now reads, for example, "Background jobs run on
  llama3.2, the chat model, because smart model routing is off", from one
  server function (`utility_resolution`) that `utility_model()` itself uses.
  The routing switch beside it also showed unchecked whenever Settings was
  opened on Models, because only Background tasks ever filled it in; it now
  reads the stored value when Models opens. Label in sentence case.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The whiteboard context bar's "More" menu opens against the bar in a short
  window. When neither side of the bar held the whole menu it was pinned
  wherever it fitted, which at 947x608 (the 1184x760 window at 125% zoom) put
  it over the bar it came from, 86px from either edge. It now takes the side
  with more room, ends 2px from the bar's edge and scrolls inside that height.
  The Size field and the bar's centre line were measured and already right on
  this head (Size shows "16" and "128" whole in its 62px; every control
  centred on one line, 0px spread).
- Library, Images: a "Kinds" menu beside the search box shows sketches,
  uploaded images or both, and the sort applies to whatever is left. A
  sketch is the PNG the sketch pad saves as `sketch-<stamp>.png`; each kind's
  count is in its row, and the last kind on cannot be turned off. The menu is
  the Timeline's own "Kinds" dock menu, Images only, as the read filter is
  Files only. The same pass fixes both kinds menus drawing a short label
  centred between its icon and its switch (the Library's two at 669 and
  637px, now both 632).
- The Agent activity panel is laid out on one grid. Its head is the app's
  panel-head recipe (the title, then three icon buttons with tooltips, all on
  one centre line), and every run row is four columns: fold marker, icon,
  name, state pill. The detail line and the bar start under the name rather
  than 33px to the left of it, a long name or detail truncates to one line
  with the whole text on hover, the state is a tinted pill whose right edge
  is the same on every row, and a run's steps start under its icon. Measured
  at 1184x760 by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/monitorgrid.js`: header centres
  within 0px, name, detail and bar left edges all at 80.4px, pills all
  ending at 388.4px, the first row 57px rather than 96px.
- The weekly digest no longer opens with a greeting or a sentence announcing
  itself, and no longer turns "tonight" in yesterday's note into tonight.
  Each note reaches the model with the day it was written and the prompt
  names today, with an instruction to read relative words against the note's
  own day and to say past ones as past; the previous "use no time
  references" instruction is gone. The answer trim the Ask tab uses now runs
  on the digest too, and also recognises "Based on the notes you provided,
  here is a quick digest...".
- Mind maps show in the Find anything search as mind maps, with their own
  filter chip and glyph, and are found by the words written on their topics,
  not only by their title (a board's text boxes likewise find the board).
  Maps had been indexed as boards, and only the `# Title` line of either was
  indexed. An existing index is put right at the next start by a diff over
  the boards, a no-op once done.
- Switching the background art to "Still", or changing the style, theme or
  accent while it is still, no longer blanks the background for most of a
  second: the old picture stays up until the new still frame has finished
  encoding (measured over 700ms at 1440x900 in headless Chromium), then
  swaps.
- The new background art no longer costs the text on the page any
  contrast. Measured against the real pixels behind every text element on
  the Dashboard (three moments per style), the first versions of the bright
  aurora, the constellation, the mesh and the mycelium took muted labels such
  as "Start something" and "Jump to" under WCAG AA where the old styles had
  not. In the dark theme a style's colours are now capped in luminance, and
  in the light theme floored, while it builds them (never per frame): every
  style now fails no more text than the art-off page does in the light theme
  (3 over three captures), and at most as many in the dark.
- The packaged Windows app now says what is wrong when it cannot show its
  window, instead of a blank or missing graphic with nothing in any log.
  Reported directly on the .exe build: pywebview's Windows backend needs the
  Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, which the app bundles the loader for but
  not the runtime itself, and a machine without it installed could get a
  launcher with no visible feedback at all. Detected once, before the window
  is created (the same registry key Microsoft's own docs point at), and
  answered with a native message box plus the official installer page opened
  automatically. Not verified against a real machine reproducing the report;
  the detection logic itself is tested against a faked registry, in both
  directions and against a broken registry call, which must never crash the
  launcher.
- The MSI build is switched off in the release workflow. WiX Toolset v7 now
  refuses to build at all without accepting its Open Source Maintenance Fee
  EULA, which had also been taking the working .exe upload down with it: a
  failed step ends the job before the upload step runs. The MSI stays in the
  file, disabled, until the EULA is accepted or an older WiX is pinned.
- Answers arrive without their padding. A greeting, an announcement of what
  the model is about to do, and a closing offer of further help are taken off
  before anything else reads the answer, so the saved turn, the export and the
  grounding marks all see the same text. Conservative on purpose: a qualifier
  like "based on your notes" is part of the claim and stays, and a pleasantry
  that is the whole answer stays too, since an empty answer says less than a
  useless one.
- Tesseract only reads a page when it is the reader you chose. Storing each
  page's regions stopped the repeated reads, but a first look at a page still
  ran Tesseract whether or not you had picked it, which is how a page meant
  for the vision model came back transcribed by the other one, and how an
  edited reading could be replaced by one nobody asked for. The workspace now
  says whether an automatic read is wanted, and answers honestly with "use
  Read this page" when it is not.
- The chat header no longer draws a hairline to the left of its icon. The
  dock's divider rule puts one before every zone after the first, and the
  first zone there is the phone sidebar button, which is not drawn on a
  desktop, so the line stood between nothing and the thread mark.
- The Windows splash screen can be got out of the way. It is a borderless
  window that sits above everything, so a first install that pulls a model
  could hold the screen for minutes with no way to move it aside. There is a
  Minimise button beside Cancel now, and it drops the always-on-top flag while
  minimised so the window restores from the taskbar without jumping back in
  front of what you moved to.
- The guided tour is switched off while it is being fixed. Every door into it
  is disabled and says why: the welcome's last panel offers "Get started"
  instead of starting a tour, and the replay buttons in Settings, Help are
  greyed. One flag in `tour.js` turns it back on.
- The Ask tab's matching records read better: the reference number is a
  square in the top right rather than a rectangle on the left, the badges and
  the timestamp share their rows instead of the date taking one of its own,
  and a note's connection labels are cut at 48 characters rather than 28, so
  a wide card no longer stops two thirds of the way along a row with room to
  spare.
- Two more suggested models, Unsloth's quantisation-aware 4-bit copies of the
  two Gemma MoE models, which are roughly half the download for close to the
  same answers.
- The Ask tab's "show the N notes used" button is gone. It counted the notes
  the Matching records column is already showing and scrolled to the first one
  cited, which is a second door to a list on screen beside the answer that
  already carries the answer's own numbers on its rows. Sources the column
  does not hold, a file or a web page, keep their cards.
- The Ask tab's progress indicator is inside the answer, not above it. The
  dots, "the model is thinking" and the rotating line were drawn above the AI
  ANSWER heading while the bubble underneath held a second set of dots and
  nothing else, so one answer had two indicators and neither was where the
  text would appear. There is one now, in the bubble it is filling.
- A matching record's reference number sits in the top right corner and no
  longer moves the text. On the left it was paid for with padding, which
  indented every line of the card to make room for a mark that only occupies
  the first one.
- The welcome's last panel names both answers. Its primary says "Start the
  tour", and the button beside it, which has always closed the welcome and
  counted as declining the tour, said only "Skip". It says "Skip the tour"
  there, and its tooltip says the tour is still in Settings, Help whenever
  you want it.
- **What the notebook costs while nobody is touching it, measured and then
  cut** (INBOX 266, item 7). With no browser attached the server is asleep:
  0.04s of CPU across 23 threads in 30 seconds, 0.13% of one core, because
  every background piece blocks rather than polls. The cost is the open tab,
  and two things in it were being paid for nothing. Two HH:MM clocks ticked
  once a second and wrote the string already on screen 59 times out of 60;
  they are scheduled on the wall-clock minute now (`startMinuteTicker`),
  which is cheaper *and* more correct, since the status bar's clock was a
  30s interval and could show a minute that had already passed. The model
  status poll asked twice a minute for as long as the app stayed open, and
  every one of those asks reaches Ollama; it now doubles to a two-minute
  ceiling while the answer is identical and drops back to 30s on any change,
  on returning to the tab, on opening Settings or on starting a job.
  Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/idle.js`, which now counts timer fires
  as well as live intervals: **timer wakes in an idle visible minute 124 to
  5, requests 4 to 2** (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 10's gate for this row),
  and idle CPU **6.01% and 6.11% of one core to 5.50% and 5.59%**
  (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/idlecpu.js`, one server, one notebook, frontend
  swapped). The honest reading is in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: nearly all of
  what is left is the Dashboard's emblem animating on purpose, which parking
  the app on Notes prices at 2.09% against 5.55%.
- **Why the notes live in SQLite, written down as a decision** rather than
  re-argued (INBOX 266, item 7, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): one file to
  back up, no server to install, transactions that are what "no silent
  loss" is built on, FTS5 search in the same file and written in the same
  transaction, and 1.8 KB per note measured at 50,000 notes. With where it
  would stop being right (concurrent writers, multi-device sync, a vector
  index past these sizes), and why "containers spun up as needed like
  serverless" is the right instinct for a different machine.

- **What happens when the disk fills up, measured on a real full filesystem
  and then made honest** (INBOX 266, item 6). An 80 MB tmpfs was mounted as
  the data dir and filled to 100%, and the app driven against it. Saving a
  note already answered 507 with a sentence about disk space, and reading,
  searching and exporting kept working throughout; three things were wrong.
  **Unlocking answered 507**, so a full disk locked the person out of their
  own notebook entirely, over the audit row written beside the unlock: the
  unlock's two writes are now committed separately and an out-of-space
  failure costs only itself. **A failed backup left a zero-byte file named
  like a backup**, which listed as one, passed `PRAGMA integrity_check`
  (an empty file is a valid empty database), and would have replaced the
  whole notebook with nothing if restored: backups are now written to a
  `.partial` sibling and renamed into place only once whole, empty files
  are never listed or counted as the daily backup, and restoring one is
  refused by name. **A failed upload or export left its half-written file
  behind**, orphaned and taking up the space the person was short of: all
  three streaming writes now clean up after themselves. A single ASGI
  guard (`SpaceGuard`) refuses a write larger than the room left before a
  byte of it is read, so the app can no longer fill the last megabyte and
  lock itself out; the 507 now names the folder, how much is free and
  roughly how much to free up, that sentence reaches every toast in the
  app, and `GET /storage` reports `free_bytes` beside `data_dir_writable`,
  which stayed `true` throughout on a disk that was 100% full. Settings →
  Data carries a `.notice notice-warn` line when the room left is low.

- The reading workspace stops re-reading a scanned page every time you look
  at it, and its reading panel covers the whole document again (INBOX 314).
  Three findings from one report. Where each block sits on a page is now
  stored beside that page's reading and served from there, so an optical
  reader runs once per page rather than once per look: a scroll down and back
  up over a six page scan went from 13 reader calls to 6, and four looks at
  one image from 4 to 1, measured with a fake reader counting its own calls.
  The panel lists every page the app has something for, in page order, rather
  than choosing between the stored reading of every page and the sections of
  the page on screen: Tesseract returns sections for every page, so that
  choice always came down on the second, which is why only one page of text
  could be seen, why it did not follow the pages as they scrolled, and why
  clicking a section could not move the document. Scroll mode itself measured
  healthy on a six page scan and was left alone, except that it no longer
  keeps its own button lit while quietly showing one page.
- Agent mode silently downgraded to a plain answer when the active model
  couldn't call tools, with nothing on screen to say so or how to fix it
  (INBOX 272 part 1's survey). The turn now shows a notice naming the
  model and one button to change it in Settings, Models; a skill run that
  stops mid-way for the same reason names the same fix in its step card.
  `requirements.txt`'s "Optional extras" comment had also drifted behind
  `core/extras.py`'s own allowlist (three installable extras were never
  named there); both are held in step now by `tests/test_failure_remedies.py`.
- The guided tour can no longer close itself halfway through. A step whose
  control it could not find was dropped from the run, and when that took the
  last one the tour ended silently on whatever tab it had just opened, which
  is what pressing Next looked like. Steps are judged after the scroll that
  brings them into view rather than during it, so far fewer are dropped at
  all, and the last one is never dropped: it stays on screen and says the
  control is not visible at this window size.
- The fold arrows in a document's gutter are the app's own icons and line up
  with the numbers beside them. They were the editor's default text triangle,
  which came out as a typed letter in this app's font and sat a little above
  the line it folded, because a character's box belongs to the font rather
  than to the row.
- The bottom bar's history no longer says you have been somewhere you have
  not. On a fresh load that never left the dashboard it listed two visits to
  Notes, because two start-up steps set the Notes tab's default sub-tab while
  that tab was hidden and each was recorded as an arrival. Setting a hidden
  tab's default is not a navigation, so it is not recorded as one, and Back is
  correctly dead until you actually go somewhere.
- Everything read from a file can be copied in one press. The reading panel in
  the Files sub-tab now has a Copy text button beside Open reading, because
  the box it sits under is capped and scrolls, so copying a long reading meant
  dragging through a window. The reading workspace already had the control and
  now says so in words rather than only an icon.
- Two things the Documents agent measured and left for later (INBOX 273).
  The settings Extras row's action buttons (Reinstall/Remove) could push
  past the panel's right edge at 820px because their column never shrank;
  it now takes `min-width: 0` and wraps instead. The shared `enhanceSelect`
  dropdown never read an `<optgroup>`'s label, so grouping set on any
  `<select>` (the whiteboard/mind-map board picker, the Library's document
  property filter) was invisible in the menu a reader actually opens; it
  now draws a group label row per `<optgroup>`, and the Library's flat-text
  workaround for the gap came back out.
- Four low-severity findings from a release security audit (INBOX 310).
  Restoring a backup now writes into a temp file beside the live database,
  runs `PRAGMA integrity_check`, and only then swaps it in atomically,
  instead of streaming pages straight into `memorymap.db`. Importing a
  folder of markdown notes now caps each file at the same size the upload
  importer already enforces, and reports a skip count when one is hit,
  instead of reading every file whole with no ceiling. A bookmark's URL is
  now checked against the same scheme allowlist (http, https, mailto, tel)
  markdown links already use, rejected with a 422 naming the allowed
  schemes if it isn't, and guarded again at render time so a bookmark saved
  before this existed can't become a live link either. The update
  downloader now re-validates every redirect hop against its host
  allowlist instead of only the first one, keeping the real
  github.com-to-objects.githubusercontent.com hop working.
- The graph's full screen no longer spends one Escape on two things. Opening
  the lightbox over a full-screen map and pressing Escape used to close the
  lightbox *and* leave full screen in the same press, because the full-screen
  handler relied on being placed after other Escape handlers rather than on
  anything actually stopping the key. It now asks `activeOverlay()` whether
  something is open over the map first (INBOX 275).
- A saved graph view restores where the unpinned notes sat, not only the
  layout, colour rule, filters, groups and zoom. Reopening a force-layout view
  used to solve the same forces fresh rather than show the picture that was
  saved; it now seeds the simulation with each note's saved spot and starts
  at rest, reheating only for a note added since the view was saved, while
  holding every saved note in place until that settles (GRAPH_PLAN Phase 5).

### Added

- An answer that finishes after you closed its panel now says so. Close the
  popup agent or the Atlas guide while it is still answering, and when the
  answer arrives a notification is recorded in the bell ("Popup agent
  answered: ..." or "Atlas answered: ...") with a toast carrying an Open
  button; either one reopens that panel scrolled to the answer. Nothing is
  posted while the panel is open, or for a turn you stopped, and the mute and
  "Panel only" switches still apply. Verified in a browser with both streams
  held for two seconds (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/unwatched.js`); not verified
  against a real model.
- The Chat tab, the Ask tab and Write with Atlas each have a model dropdown
  beside where you type, the same setting as that feature's row in Settings,
  Models: change either and the other follows on the next status tick. It
  names the model that will actually run ("Inherited: llama3.2", resolved
  through the role and smart routing), and keeps showing a chosen model that
  is not installed. The Ask tab is its own row now (it had been running on
  the Chat tab's choice without saying so), and the feature rows ride every
  status poll, so the Chat tab's and the documents assistant's model sheets
  no longer say "Models aren't available yet" until Settings has been opened.
- Two new background art styles grown from your display name, after the
  owner's helixlabs project (MIT; its `generateDNAProfile` idea, credited in
  `frontend/bg-art.js`): the letters of the name, each weighted by its
  place, choose every trait of three to five species. **Microbes** is an
  ecosystem of swimming organisms (round, rod, comma, diatom, amoeba or
  flagellate bodies; wandering, schooling, orbiting, tracing a figure or
  clustering) that divide when there is room and fade with age; **Mycelium**
  is a network of threads that germinate, branch, rest, fade and grow again
  elsewhere. Settings says which species your name grew, and a new display
  name regrows them.
- Two sweeps for the background art. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/bgartcost.js`
  times each style's frame inside the page (the draw plus the raster it
  forces, over five seconds), samples its allocations over ten seconds with
  the heap profiler, and checks that "Still" leaves no loop and no canvas
  behind; `bgart.js` timed the frame interval, which sits on the 16.7ms
  vsync floor for any style that fits in a frame and so could not tell a
  2ms style from a 12ms one. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/bgartcontrast.js`
  measures text contrast against the real pixels behind each text element
  with the art on, which `contrast.js` cannot see through glass.
- A lint on the release artifact naming scheme (INBOX 266, item 4).
  `tests/test_release_smoke_step.py` now also parses `installer.iss`'s
  `OutputBaseFilename` and fails if the Windows `.exe`'s own filename loses
  its version, platform or architecture; the `.msi`, `.tar.gz` and `.zip`
  were already linted the same way. The `.tar.gz` for Linux (item 2) and the
  `.msi` for Windows (item 3) both already existed on this branch, verified
  by reading `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `packaging/windows/
  installer.iss` and `packaging/windows/installer.wxs`; nothing was rebuilt.
  The naming scheme itself, `<name>-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.<ext>`
  across all four artifacts, is recorded as a decision in
  `WORLD_CLASS_PLAN.md`'s H6.
- A cross-link on a mind map now survives an export. FreeMind files carry it
  in their own arrow element, so a map opened in FreeMind, Freeplane or
  Coggle is drawn with its cross-links; OPML files carry it as an attribute
  other readers ignore and this one reads back. Both come back intact on
  import. The Markdown outline stays an outline, which is what that file is
  for.
- A mind map can hold a look of its own, so a topic no longer has to be
  dressed one at a time. Ten of the eleven things you can set on a topic, its
  text size, weight, slant and alignment, its box and the bar down its edge,
  and the thickness, shape, dash and arrowhead of the branch into it, can now
  be set once for the whole map, and every topic that was never told otherwise
  follows. A topic you did decorate by hand keeps exactly what you gave it: a
  map-wide change can never overwrite a choice somebody made.
- And one way to undo the lot: "bring every topic back to the map" drops the
  colours, shapes and line styles that were set on topics one at a time, so
  they all follow the map again. It is the ring's own "reset to branch" said
  about the whole map rather than one topic, and it takes one request whatever
  the map's size. Pictures stay, because a picture is content rather than a
  look.
- A whiteboard or a mind map can live inside a note as an object: a preview
  card of the board itself, with its name and how much is on it, that opens
  the board when pressed. It is written `![[board:12|House jobs]]`, by id, so
  renaming the board does not break the note. A board that has been deleted
  leaves a card saying what was there rather than taking a paragraph of the
  note with it. An embedded board used to render as "Nothing called House
  jobs yet", which was the one case the transclusion renderer never learnt.
- The "/" menu in a note can insert one: "Board or mind map", which offers
  your boards and maps and writes the object where the caret is.
- The other way round as well: a board's own Board menu, and its card in the
  Library, now offer "Add to a note", which asks which note and puts the
  board in it.
- A note now shows what it made you promise to do: a "2 reminders" chip on
  the card opens the list of them, and each one presses through to the
  Reminders tab. Reminders could already be attached to a note and say which
  note they came from; the note end of that link had nothing on it.
- A link to a board that has been deleted now says so, rather than offering
  to create a note named after the board's address.

### Changed

- The app's emblem is drawn once and turned by a CSS rotation instead of a
  p5 sketch redrawn 24 times a second for every emblem on the page, at the
  same speed (one turn in 43.6 seconds). The architecture notes had it as
  about 3.5 of the 5.5 CPU points an idle Dashboard cost; the page now runs
  no animation-frame callbacks at all with the background art off (240 in
  two seconds before, measured).
- Every background art style but the waves is redrawn, and the whole
  background is lighter to run. The aurora is now curtains of light, the
  constellation has stars at three depths with a nebula and the odd meteor,
  the floating orbs are glass bubbles at three depths, and the mesh is slow
  colour fields that blend; the waves look as they did. Measured at
  1440x900, default intensity, paint per frame: the aurora 5.97ms to about
  1ms, the mesh 3.02ms and the bubbles 1.87ms to nothing at all (both are CSS
  animations now, moved by the compositor), the waves 2.38ms to 0.88ms, the
  constellation 1.92ms to 2.14ms with 40% more stars; allocations over ten
  seconds fell from between 13MB and 46MB a style to under 5MB. The art no longer
  uses p5, runs at 30 frames a second (20 on battery or a small machine),
  stops when the window is hidden, unfocused for thirty seconds, idle for two
  minutes or covered, and "Still" is now one captured image with nothing
  running behind it.
- A big mind map redraws only what changed. A change to one topic used to
  rebuild every topic and every line on the board, which is why a large map
  felt heavy to work on: at five hundred topics a redraw took just over half
  a second of frozen tab, and opening such a map took two seconds. A redraw
  after moving a topic is now 47.8ms, a redraw that changes every topic at
  once is 149.1ms, and the same map opens in under a second. Picking up a
  branch on a board that also holds hundreds of link lines went from a full
  second of stall to a tenth of one.
- The first screen tells you what you are agreeing to. It asked for a password
  in 26 words that never said what the app is, never said it runs on your own
  machine, never gave the length rule until you had already failed, and never
  mentioned that the password becomes the key to anything you later mark
  private. All four are on it now, before you type.
- A mind map can be laid out to the left, and on both sides of its trunk,
  which is the arrangement most mind-mapping tools are pictured in. The
  branches are split so the two sides hold about the same number of topics
  rather than the same number of branches, and a topic whose parent is to its
  right carries its branch bar on that side.
- A mind map now answers the two gestures anybody tries on a blank part of it.
  A right-click on empty canvas opens a short menu of the things that apply to
  the map itself: add a topic here, tidy it, open every folded branch, fit
  everything. A double-click makes a new trunk where the pointer was, ready to
  be typed, and it stays where it was put. Both did nothing at all before.
- A mind map now says which of its two kinds of connection it is talking
  about, everywhere it talks about one. A branch and a cross-link get the same
  ring, which names the kind it is on and offers the right three things for
  it, including turning a cross-link into a branch when the drawing gesture
  guessed wrong; the tool rail says cross-link on a map and link on a board;
  and a cross-link is drawn in the map's own ink, dashed, from the moment it
  is drawn rather than from the next time the board is opened. It used to take
  the pen's colour, so one drawn while the ink was red read as a branch.
- The bar that appears over a selected topic on a mind map is a third of the
  width it was. It carried fourteen icons in one run, 959px of controls to
  describe a topic 95px wide, which at 1024 took 94% of the window and at no
  width drew a single word; the same fourteen controls now sit behind three
  named doors on it, Text, Shape and Branch line, each of which labels every
  control inside it. The bar measures 314px at 1440, 1024 and 820, and 54px
  tall instead of 150px on a phone.
- The guide answers the question you asked. Three plain questions reached no
  help topic at all ("Can I use this offline?", "How do I add a tag?", "Can I
  import from Obsidian?"), so it answered them from whatever tab you happened
  to be on. Twenty-six plainly worded questions now reach the right entry, and
  a phrase like "web search" beats a bare "search" instead of losing to
  whichever topic came first in the list.
- The graph's zoom controls are drawn like the rest of the app. Zoom in, zoom
  out and fit were typed characters sitting beside a full-screen button drawn
  with a real icon; all four now match, 34px square with an 18.4px icon
  centred in each.
- An answer the notebook barely backs says so. Under half its sentences
  coming from your notes, a line above the answer now says how many did and
  that the rest is the model's own writing. The marks under each sentence have
  always said which ones were grounded; nothing said how few.
- Typing the first word of a "/" command now finds it first. Every command
  label used to open with an emoji, so the menu's "starts with what you typed"
  ranking could never match anything and every search fell through to keyword
  guessing.
- The "/" menu tells you it is there, and opens from the keyboard. Every
  writing box now says "Press / for blocks and commands" while it is empty,
  and Ctrl+/ opens the same menu without you having to know the trick. The
  chord is rebindable and listed with the other shortcuts.
- The "/" menu works again in the note box, the note edit form, the chat
  composer and a skill's steps. It had stopped opening in all four: the file
  that builds an editing surface moved into the Library's on-demand bundle,
  and until you happened to open Library or Documents there was nothing for
  the menu to attach to, so the slash did nothing and said nothing. Measured
  on a fresh load: 0 menu rows before, 14 after. The bundle is now fetched the
  moment you put the caret in one of those boxes, and the keystroke that found
  it missing is replayed once it lands, so even the first "/" of a session
  opens a menu.
- Every row of the "/" menu draws the app's own icon instead of an emoji.
  Thirty-eight of them were emoji, written as escapes, which is how they sat
  through a lint that exists to catch exactly this; the eight callout kinds
  were drawing theirs at the head of every callout in every note and document
  as well. The Library's create menu, the chat attachment close, a note embed's
  marker and two graph arrows went the same way. The lint now reads an escaped
  character as the character it is, so the next one cannot hide the same way.
- Buttons that share a row share a height, and a probe now holds it. The
  greeting's "Add your name" was 29.2px beside its own 28px close button, the
  last mixed row of seventy in the app. The one-line change that would have
  ended the underlying 40-against-42px difference for good was measured
  instead of taken: it moved eighteen buttons, put a half pixel into five
  graph controls and turned a text link into a box, so it was not taken.
- A mind map can be laid out to the left, and on both sides of its trunk,
  which is the arrangement most mind-mapping tools are pictured in. The
  branches are split so the two sides hold about the same number of topics
  rather than the same number of branches, and a topic whose parent is to its
  right carries its branch bar on that side.
- A mind map now answers the two gestures anybody tries on a blank part of it.
  A right-click on empty canvas opens a short menu of the things that apply to
  the map itself: add a topic here, tidy it, open every folded branch, fit
  everything. A double-click makes a new trunk where the pointer was, ready to
  be typed, and it stays where it was put. Both did nothing at all before.
- A mind map now says which of its two kinds of connection it is talking
  about, everywhere it talks about one. A branch and a cross-link get the same
  ring, which names the kind it is on and offers the right three things for
  it, including turning a cross-link into a branch when the drawing gesture
  guessed wrong; the tool rail says cross-link on a map and link on a board;
  and a cross-link is drawn in the map's own ink, dashed, from the moment it
  is drawn rather than from the next time the board is opened. It used to take
  the pen's colour, so one drawn while the ink was red read as a branch.
- The bar that appears over a selected topic on a mind map is a third of the
  width it was. It carried fourteen icons in one run, 959px of controls to
  describe a topic 95px wide, which at 1024 took 94% of the window and at no
  width drew a single word; the same fourteen controls now sit behind three
  named doors on it, Text, Shape and Branch line, each of which labels every
  control inside it. The bar measures 314px at 1440, 1024 and 820, and 54px
  tall instead of 150px on a phone.
- The loading bar on the splash screen is cheaper to draw, so it stays smooth
  on a slow machine, which is the only kind of machine that sees it for long.
  It used to grow by changing its width, which made the browser lay the page
  out again on every frame: 121 times over one 2.4 second load, against none
  now that it scales instead. Every animation in the app is now held to that
  by a lint, so the next one cannot quietly cost more.
- A mind map no longer freezes when a topic is picked up. Dragging a topic
  carries its branch, and the frame that took hold of it was doing the work
  once per topic in the branch rather than once per thing that moved: a board
  scan to find each one, three document-wide queries per line to find its
  parts, and a fresh measurement of both ends of every line on every frame.
  Measured on `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mapperf.js`, the worst frame of a drag
  falls from 83.3 to 16.8ms on a 50-topic map, 416.6 to 33.3ms at 200 and
  1,650 to 66.8ms at 500. Opening a map and laying it out got faster with it,
  from 3.4 to 2.0 seconds at 500 topics.
- The app calls Atlas by name in eight more places. Five of them are the
  Tools and features descriptions, which said "the assistant" while teaching
  you what the app can do, and one was the persona hint explaining how to
  write the name.
- No phantom row under a table's header in the documents live view. Putting
  the caret in a header row grew the line from 29.2px to 54.8px, because the
  table is a grid whose rows were all implicit, so CodeMirror's own trailing
  line break was auto-placed into a second one. The table's menu also no
  longer moves the caret out of the table when it is pressed.
- The guided tour is legible and the page behind it is genuinely dimmed.
  Reported three times, the last as "the whole tour is completely and utterly
  broken". The dim was one giant shadow cast by the cut-out, whose reach
  depended on the window's shape and on a corner radius nothing could read;
  it is now painted by the four panels that already tile the window around
  the hole, so a lit strip is a failing test rather than a photograph. The
  step card was see-through, and the dashboard clock read straight through
  its text; it now has the same opaque ground as every other dialog.
- The bottom status bar has three zones and its right end has an owner.
  Reported: the navigation and undo buttons "keep getting pushed further and
  further to the left". They were: the run after the spacer was one flat list,
  so every control the bar gained was appended at its right end, and reading
  it right to left gives the order they arrived in. Measured at 1440 against
  the bar's content edge, redo ended 391px from it and the navigation group
  467px. The bar now has state (what the app is holding or doing, left end,
  and the only zone that shrinks), tools (the doorways, and the only zone that
  grows) and control (back, forward, history, undo, redo), which ends the bar
  and takes no new members. Redo is flush with the content edge and the
  navigation group 76px from it, and a control added tomorrow lands in tools
  and pushes tools along. On a phone, where the bar scrolls sideways, the
  controls come first instead, so undo, redo and Back are reachable without
  dragging the bar.

- The dashboard's focused view puts the greeting and the search field on one
  row. Focused had a 47.2px banner saying who you are and, 16px under it, the
  37.2px field that is the only thing a stripped dashboard is reached for:
  100.4px of head to say one thing and offer one control. The banner keeps its
  width on the left and the field takes the rest of the line and the row's
  height, so the head is 47.2px and the chrome above the widgets falls from
  196 to 158.8px. Full and compact are unchanged, and a phone stacks the two
  back up.

- The text extracted from a file shows one more line. In Library, Files, the
  box that opens under "Text extracted from this file" was 64px against an
  18px line, so three and a half lines of a reading that can run to forty
  pages. It is 82px, four and a half lines, which is as far as it can go
  before the row below it leaves the screen on a phone.

- Atlas answers about reminders, documents, notes, spaces and backups again.
  The help corpus had an entry for each of them, and the keyword match was
  written in the singular, so a question asked in the plural reached none of
  them: "Where do reminders live?" was answered with "I'm not sure", from the
  notes and memory entries the open tab supplied instead. Keywords now cover
  the plural and the possessive, a tab's own topics fill in only for a
  question that names nothing, and the corpus gained an entry for the status
  bar, which nothing covered.
- The questions Atlas suggests follow the tab you are on, and every one of
  them is a question the help corpus can answer. The three fixed suggestions
  included one it could not answer at all and two about turning features off.
- Atlas can be typed into with no model running. It carried the attribute
  that disables an AI control when no model is there, although it was built
  to answer from the app's own help text without one.
- The guide no longer promises the utility model outright. It answers on the
  utility model while smart model routing is on, on the chat model while it
  is off, and Settings, Models can give it a model of its own; the panel's
  '?' says so.
- The mind map has been measured against the six things it was reported for,
  and the report that it is slow is true and is one bug. Panning holds 60fps
  at 50, 200 and 500 topics and the layout maths is cheap; a full re-render is
  not, and it runs when a topic is picked up, so a 500-topic map freezes for
  over a second the instant a finger goes down on a node. The read, the
  numbers and the phases that follow from them are MINDMAP_PLAN section 13;
  two probes hold the figures, `mapperf.js` and `maptwokinds.js`.

- Typing part of a word finds it again. The find anything box tried a word as
  a prefix only from four letters, so a note called "test" appeared for "test"
  and not for "tes". Three letters is enough now, and the finder and the note
  search read one threshold instead of each keeping their own.
- Atlas is shown the tags your notebook already uses before it suggests new
  ones. It was told only which tags were on the note in front of it, so it had
  no way to know the notebook already said "ml" and would happily suggest
  "machine learning" beside it. Now it is asked to reuse an existing tag when
  one fits.
- A note with no tags offers to have them written. The action that reads a
  note, suggests tags and links and refiles it was one row deep in the note's
  menu under the name "Re-evaluate", which said the smallest part of what it
  does. It is now "Tag and file with Atlas", and a note with no tags carries
  the offer on the card, where the tags would be.
- The spinner beside "Re-evaluating" on a note is a circle in a narrow row,
  not just a wide one. It sat in a flex row and could be squeezed on the
  width while its height held, so it turned as an ellipse; it now keeps its
  shape whatever the row does.
- A plain highlight in the documents live view is yellow again, and a
  coloured one says its colour instead of showing it. The live view had one
  highlight rule, taking the blue of the app's named set, so every plain
  highlight was blue; and it never read the colour prefix, so `==blue|word==`
  drew "blue|word". Both views now read the same eight colours and take the
  same tokens in both themes.
- The board's top bar carries six controls beside its five menus, down from
  eight: Rename this board and New board moved into the Board menu, which is
  already where this board's own life is kept. On a phone it carries seven in
  all, down from eleven, and no longer runs past its own right edge (75px past
  at 320, 5px at 390, both now 0): Full screen and Arrange leave the bar below
  600, the first being in the View menu and the second being on the context
  bar above a selection, which is the only time it can act. Its five menus
  declared `role="menu"` with no `role="menuitem"` inside, so a screen reader
  was told the menu was empty and the arrow keys moved nothing; they now take
  their roles and their keyboard from the same two places every other menu in
  the app does, and Escape hands the focus back to the toggle that opened them.

- The Files sub-tab's "Text extracted from this file" block is the numbers, the
  reading and one way in. Opening it used to draw four ranks and two controls,
  the first sentence, "14 pages read · 808 words", a full-width "Show the whole
  reading" bar and an "Open reading" button, and the one thing not in that list
  was the reading. It is now "14 pages · 808 words" with Open reading at the end
  of the same line and the reading itself under it, capped at three lines and
  scrolling. Measured at 1440 on a fourteen-page reading: two ranks instead of
  four, one control instead of two, the block 110.4px rather than 120.8px, and
  the row 251.9px open rather than 262.3px with the text still one click away.

- A picture card's reading is one chip, and the chip opens the picture. Asking
  to see the text used to expand the card from 240.7px to 416.3px and draw six
  rows under the thumbnail, a label, the text, a Show more, Tesseract's own box
  and the two model names, and the gallery gives every card in a row the tallest
  one's height. The "Text" chip opens the lightbox at the reading instead, where
  the picture, the caption, the whole text and both bylines already sit together,
  so the card does not move. The model names are on the card's tooltip. Typing a
  reading by hand is still the card menu's "Type the text in this picture".

- The dashboard's Compact and Focused views keep the hero. Compact used to
  delete the one line that says anything about this notebook ("You have 218
  notes, 3 reminders due") and cut the greeting to below body size while keeping
  the clock at twice the greeting's height, and Focused, the level that shows
  least, carried the second largest banner of the three: measured at 1440, the
  three heroes stood 157.2, 76.3 and 133.2px tall. The rule now is one rule: the
  greeting and the one number stay at every level, and what shrinks is the art
  and the secondary rows. The greeting steps down the type scale rather than
  falling off it, the emblem shrinks from 46px to 30px before it goes, the clock
  loses its date and then itself, and Compact's three band labels move onto
  their rows' own line. The heroes are 157.2, 99.6 and 47.2px, and the chrome
  above the first widget is 593.6, 427.9 and 196px (it was 593.6, 456.6 and
  282px).

- The Timeline's table keeps its width when a note row is opened. The Title
  column, the one column with no width of its own, was halving: 1032 to 516 at
  1930, 702 to 351 at 1600, 542 to 271 at 1440, with the other half drawn as
  empty space past the last header. The open row's cell spanned one column more
  than the table draws, because the tick column is only there while the
  selection mode is on, and a fixed table layout answers an extra column by
  splitting the free space with it.
- The Library reader is the page on a phone. It opened as a 342x776 dialog
  inset from every edge of a 390px screen, with an X in its head and its
  Copy, Ask and Save as note under a transcription you had to scroll to; it
  is the whole screen now, with a back chevron and those actions in a bar at
  the bottom where a thumb is, the same shape a note opened on a phone
  already had. Every control in it takes the 44px touch floor.

- The whiteboard and the mind map answer a finger. Two fingers pan and zoom the
  board whatever tool is in hand, which is what every drawing app reserves them
  for: until now a pinch did nothing at all unless you first went and found the
  Pan tool. The tool rail below 600 is one button saying which tool is in hand,
  opening a sheet with every tool in it at a size a thumb can hit, in place of a
  56px band that scrolled 835px of tools through a 358px window and showed 16 of
  its 31 buttons. The board's own bar takes the same 44px floor as the rest of
  the app on a touch screen. The mind map's + handles were already touch-sized
  and are unchanged.

- The graph answers a finger on a phone. A hold on a node opens the node menu
  (the same menu a right-click opens, now the app's own pointer-menu recipe, so
  its rows are 44px, Escape closes it and it cannot be drawn off the edge of the
  window); a hold on the empty map arms the lasso, which until now needed a
  Shift key a phone does not have, so a selection could not be started at all.
  The map's three floating control surfaces (the gear's panel, which covered 42%
  of a 362x653 map, the View menu and the ⋯ menu) open as one sheet below 600
  instead, holding the same controls and putting each one back on close. A hold
  anywhere in the app no longer also does whatever a tap there would do: the
  click the lift synthesises is swallowed, which is why holding a node used to
  open its menu and its panel at once.

- The rotate grip of a group selection on the whiteboard sits at the top centre
  of the group, at any zoom. It was scaled about the canvas's origin rather than
  its own anchor, so it sat right at 100% and drifted further off the box the
  further you zoomed either way: 170px right of centre and below the top edge at
  50%, 340px left of it at 200%. A group also drew every member's own handles on
  top of its own, four rotate knobs and sixteen resize handles for three items;
  members now show their outline and the group carries the grips, and anything
  selected on its own still has all of them.

- The CSS that styled the whiteboard's old export popover is gone. The popover
  became a dialog several phases ago; its class stayed in seventeen grouped
  selectors across three stylesheets, four of them rules with nothing else in
  them.

- The quick sketch pad's ink dots are a finger's size on a phone. They were
  16px targets in a bar whose every other control steps up to 44, and the
  dialog is the one place the touch sweep never looked. The dot is 32px below
  820 with the press reaching 44 past its edge, and the seven of them wrap to
  a second row rather than running off the bar at the largest text and
  spacing settings.

- On a phone, the whiteboard's context bar sits at the top of the canvas
  instead of following the selection around it. At that width it is a band
  rather than a bar, 348px of a 364px canvas, and floating put it on top of the
  drawing tools for a selection low on the board. It also stays on the canvas
  now whichever width you are at: a selection near the bottom could place it
  past the bottom edge, where nothing could reach it.

- A shape on the whiteboard follows the pointer at any zoom. Dragging one at 2x
  moved it half as far as the cursor, and its resize grip widened it half as
  far, because two drag handlers converted a delta that was already in board
  coordinates. A link's bend grip is also the same size on screen at every
  zoom now: it was 24px across at 2x against 12px at 1x, the one grip missing
  from the rule that holds every other one still.

- A highlighter stroke on the sketch pad lands under the pointer. It was
  painted through a layer that scaled coordinates a second time, so a stroke
  sat 15px left and 9px up of the cursor in the middle of the pad.

- The quick sketch pad and the whiteboard have one highlighter. They held two
  copies of it at different values, so the same tool covered the paper on one
  surface and tinted it on the other; both read one table now (0.4 opacity, a
  4x nib clamped to 12 to 24, a flat end and a round join). On the pad, picking
  an ink colour no longer quietly puts the pen back: "highlighter, then yellow"
  drew an opaque yellow line. Measured over a 255.0 paper: one pass 223.7, two
  223.7 before and 199.2 now.

- A highlighter stroke on a dark board lightens where it crosses itself instead
  of muddying. Multiply is worth 3 luminance units a pass on a dark board and 20
  on a light one, so a dark board screens and a light one multiplies; the blend
  follows a theme change on a board that is already open, and an export carries
  the blend its own background asks for. Measured dark: paper 26.4, one pass
  85.9, two passes 128.4, against 26.4 / 23.6 / 22.0 before.

- A phone opens the timeline as the table when no view has been chosen,
  and a reminder row swiped right is done.
- A phone opens a document to read it: the Rendered view is the default
  below 600 when no view has been chosen, and Edit is a press away.
- Chat on a phone: the message box takes one row with the microphone and
  Send, the attachments sit beside the mode switch under it, the mode
  switch is the first thing in that strip rather than off its right edge,
  a reply's sources open as a sheet, and the popup agent goes to the Chat
  tab instead of floating over a 390px window.
- On a phone the sidebar no longer keeps a 52px rail down the left of every
  page. It opens from a button at the start of the page's own head bar and
  the notes, conversations and documents lists take the full width.
- The notes head bar on a phone is three rows, not four: the sidebar button
  sits beside the title and the search box gives way so Filter stays on its
  line. 250px of bar became 166 at 390; the chat bar went from 166 to 114.
- The top bar on a phone is three controls: the space switcher, notifications
  and one menu holding theme, Settings, Lock and Quit. It was six, and at 320
  the last one hung off the edge so every page scrolled sideways. Every
  menu row on a phone is now 44px tall like every other control there.
- numpy, and the embedding/search-matrix code that uses it, loads on first
  use instead of at server start. `ai/embeddings.py`, `ai/janitor.py`,
  `search/engine.py` and `search/search_manager.py` had `import numpy as np`
  at module scope, so simply importing `api/app.py` (every boot) pulled
  numpy in whether or not the notebook had anything to embed yet. A fresh,
  never-used notebook now never loads numpy at all.
- The guide panel is a panel again. It floats in the bottom right corner on one
  inset with all four corners rounded, instead of sitting welded to the bottom
  edge of the window with two square corners and two insets that disagreed; on
  a phone it is still the full-width sheet it has always been there. Its '?'
  moved into the head, beside the line it explains, which gives the question
  box back around 50px; a hairline marks where the conversation ends and what
  you can send begins; the three example questions sit under the transcript and
  over that box, where the Chat tab already puts its own; and a message looks
  like a message in the Chat tab, same radius, padding, tail corner and ground,
  and it follows the compact and spacious density settings, which it used to
  ignore.

- Opening the guide's '?' and pressing Escape no longer leaves the explanation
  stranded on screen after the panel it belongs to has closed.
### Fixed

- The table menu in a document's live view survives being pressed. Clicking a
  table's header row draws a small menu button at its right end, and pressing
  it used to unmount the button and leave the menu standing under the header
  row with nothing to close it, which read as an extra empty row and as a
  button that did nothing. Two causes, both measured: the menu's own work
  (showing, measuring and, when it would be clipped, moving itself out to the
  page) was read by the editor as the document changing under it, and the
  blur that followed removed the button the person had just pressed. The menu
  now claims its own work, an open menu holds its button on screen, and a
  button taken away closes the menu with it.

### Added

- A writing suggestion's underline answers the pointer. Resting on one now
  tints the word in that suggestion's own colour, so a squiggle looks
  pressable before you press it; it was the one part of the writing help that
  gave no sign it was a control.
- The documents formatting strip says what the caret is already in. Stand in a
  bold word and Bold reads as on; the same for italic, code, the three heading
  levels, lists, tasks, quotes and links. Only the buttons that have a state
  to be in say so, so the ones that always insert something new are unchanged.
- The table cell menu is grouped. Its ten commands cover rows, columns,
  alignment and the table itself, and read as one list of ten; they now sit in
  four groups with a hairline between them.
- A "/" menu in a skill's steps box. It offers the two things the form beside
  it already knows and nobody can type from memory: the answers the skill will
  ask you for, as `{{placeholders}}`, and the exact names of the tools it has
  been allowed to use. Nothing else, because a step is one instruction on one
  line, not a block of markdown.
- A Daily page in the documents template gallery, and the Timeline now
  recognises it. New from a template offers Daily alongside the other six; it
  makes a document titled with the day, the same title the journal note uses,
  so a day written as a document gets the calendar mark in the Timeline and
  the day's own row offers to open it rather than to start a second page.
- A topic on a mind map can hold a picture. Put one in from the topic's own
  menu and the node draws as a card with the image as its body and the label
  as the caption under it, rather than a label with a thumbnail beside it. The
  file goes through the same upload every other picture in the app does, so it
  is in the Library too, and taking it out of the topic leaves it there.
- The line into a topic bends where you drag it. Point at a line, or select
  the topic at either end, and a dot appears on it: drag the dot and the line
  follows, whether it is drawn as a curve, an elbow or a straight line.
  Double-click the dot to put the line back. The shape travels with a copied
  branch and through the FreeMind and OPML exports.
- Share to MemoryMap from a phone's share sheet: with the app installed, a
  page, a link or a selection shared to it opens Capture with the title,
  the text and the link as one note ready to save.
- On a phone a note opens as a page: tap the row and the note fills the
  screen with a back chevron, unclamped, and its actions in a bar at the
  foot where a thumb is.
- On a phone a note row swipes: right to favourite, left to move it to the
  bin, the same two actions the row already shows, with the same undo.
- A "New note" button in the Notes bar, and on a phone a floating + above
  the tab bar: one press opens Capture with the caret in the box. The first
  showing of Capture used to drop the focus while it built the box's gutter
  and live editor; it carries it over now.
- A note card says what points at it: "In 1 document · on 1 board · on 1
  map · linked by 1 note", one quiet chip that opens Connections, counted
  for a whole page in one call (`GET /entries/reference-counts`). A mind
  map's own note node now counts as the note being on that map, in the
  chip, the Referenced-by row and the Connections dialog alike, and the
  dialog tells a map from a board and lists every document and note the
  chip counts.
- The Guide answers with no model running. Its whole knowledge of this app is
  hand-written help text, which is also the only source of facts a model is
  given when one does answer, so with the model off it hands that text over
  word for word, with the same quick-access chips, and says that is what it
  is doing. It used to say it was unavailable while holding the exact
  paragraph the question was about.

- A Windows MSI ships alongside the existing .exe installer
  (`MemoryMap-AI-*-windows-x86_64.msi`, built from the same PyInstaller
  output with WiX). It installs per machine rather than per user, supports
  `msiexec /quiet` for a silent or Group Policy deployment, and gets a
  proper Add/Remove Programs entry with Windows Installer's own repair and
  rollback. Unsigned for now, same as the .exe. The MSI's Start Menu group carries the same Repair shortcut
  as the .exe installer's.

- Find anything: one search over your notes, documents, boards, files, links
  and reminders at once, by your words and by what they mean, alongside the
  app's own actions. Every result says why it matched. It opens from a field
  on the dashboard, from Find in the status bar, and on Ctrl+P. The engine
  behind it already existed and nothing in the app had ever called it.

- The dashboard has a density switch: full, compact or focused. Measured
  above the widget grid, the three come to 610, 473 and 298 pixels of chrome.
  Nothing is removed by any of them.

- A note can show the notes you have forgotten that are closest to it.
  "Forgotten notes like this" sits in its menu beside "Similar notes", and
  answers a different question: not what means the same as this, but what
  you have not looked at in a long time that bears on it. The ranking was
  built and had no way in.

- A note can be put on a whiteboard or a mind map from its own menu. "Add to
  a board or map" sits beside "Add to a document" and does the same thing on
  the other kind of surface: the note becomes a card on the board, where you
  can see it and drag it, and the note's "Referenced by" row then says so.

- "Referenced by" on a note. Its menu now answers what points at it:
  the whiteboards and mind maps that carry it, the documents and notes that
  link to it, and the ones that only mention it by name, with which of the
  three said beside each. A link is a decision someone made and a mention is
  a coincidence until they make it, so the rows someone chose come first and
  the row says which it is.

- Settings, "What it learned": everything Atlas worked out on its own, with
  the note it came from, the model that decided it and how sure it was. Edit
  a row and no later run overwrites it; delete one and the same thing is
  never derived again; switch any of the seven background readers off, or
  pause all of them at once; export the lot as JSON, or forget it all
  without touching a note, and a "Read my notes now" button that runs the
  night pass on demand and says what it found. The backend for all of this
  shipped on 2026-09-13 and nothing in the app had ever called it.

- A note's own label no longer shows its wiki brackets. `[text](url)` was
  stripped from a chip and `[[a wiki link]]` was not, because the first rule
  needs the `(url)` to match, so every chip for a note whose first line links
  to another note read `[[The roof quote]]`, brackets and all.

- Battery-efficient mode stops the moving pictures. It paused the background
  AI tasks and the graph's similarity work and reached nothing else, so the
  dashboard's constellation and the animated background kept drawing, which
  is the two most expensive things on screen and the ones a person watching
  for a change would notice. Both stop now, the setting takes effect the
  moment you turn it on rather than on the next load, and its help text says
  what it does.

- A new check in the merge gate catches a request that fails where nobody is
  told. `errors.js` watches the console, which sees a thrown exception; it
  does not see a 404 or a 500 read into a `.catch(() => null)`, which is how
  most of this app reads a response it can live without, and which is the
  other half of "it does nothing and says nothing". The app currently passes
  it: zero failing requests across seven tabs, four Notes sub-tabs, six
  Library views and all eighteen Settings sections, on a fresh notebook and
  on one with four thousand notes.

- The tag autocomplete offers the tags you actually use first, and offers
  all of them. It was built from the notes loaded so far, which on a large
  notebook means it is missing whatever has not paged in yet, and sorted
  alphabetically, so a tag used once came before one used four hundred
  times. It now reads `GET /tags`, which answers tag and count, most used
  first, in one request; that route had no caller in the app at all.

- "Suggest a title" in the Writing Room. A note's title in this app is its
  leading `# Heading`, which is the one part of a long draft nobody writes,
  and the capture box has a title field while the Writing Room never did.
  `POST /drafts/title` shipped with that panel and had no caller: the model
  could name a finished draft and nothing ever asked it to. Undoable like
  every other pass there, and pressing it twice replaces the heading rather
  than stacking a second one.

- Settings, About now shows what the search can actually see: how many notes,
  documents and files are in the index, and whether the meaning-based half is
  loaded. `GET /search/stats` says in its own docstring that the Settings page
  wants this, and the Settings page had never asked.

### Fixed

- A picture read twice shows both readings in the lightbox. A file can carry
  Tesseract's own pass and a vision model's transcription at the same time,
  and the lightbox drew only the vision one, so the other reading was nowhere
  on the surface built for checking text against the picture. The second
  reader's answer now sits under the first, labelled "Also read with Tesseract
  OCR", exactly as the Library card's reading fold already showed it. A
  picture with one reading looks as it did.
- The documents formatting strip rises above the on-screen keyboard while it
  is collapsed, which is how it starts. Expanded it already did; collapsed, a
  more specific rule was overriding the keyboard inset away, so the strip you
  type at sat under the keys. What can sit under a bottom strip is now one
  named length that all three of them add.
- The Copy button on a code block and on a table is drawn with the app's own
  icon. Both said "⧉ Copy", a character typed where an icon belongs, while
  five other Copy buttons in the app used the real one. Save beside them takes
  its icon too, so the pair in one bar read as the same kind of control.
- A picture on a mind map topic is in the board's own PNG and SVG export
  instead of an empty box with a caption.
- "Clean up orphaned media" counts a picture used by a mind map topic as used.
  It looked only at pictures placed on a board as their own object, so the file
  behind a topic's picture was listed as used by nothing.
- The board's top bar answers a finger on a tablet. Between 600 and 820, the
  band whose own rule is that the pointer there is a finger, all thirteen of
  its controls were still 36px tall; and wherever the five menu buttons drop
  their words they were 25.8px wide, narrower than any other control in the
  app. The bar is two rows of 44px controls on a tablet now, and at 820 and
  above it is the single 46px row it was, with nothing under the app's own
  floor.


- The ⋯ on a Library card and on a document row is visible on a touch screen.
  Both were meant to be: each had a rule saying so where there is no pointer
  to hover with, and each was written one class short of the rule it had to
  beat, so neither ever applied and a 44x44 button sat at opacity 0 on every
  card and every row at phone width.


- The Library reader shows the page and what it says. Below 1100px the page
  rail was hidden but its column was not, so the grid kept an empty 593px of
  itself at 1024, squeezed the page into the 320px column beside it and
  pushed the transcription onto a row of its own underneath; at 390 the
  transcription had no width at all. The two panes take the two columns now.

- "Take the tour" takes you on the tour. The dashboard's tile and Settings,
  about's "Take tour again" both opened the welcome card instead, which is a
  different thing: five slides about what MemoryMap is, rather than the
  guided tour's cards anchored on the real controls. Both open the tour now,
  and the welcome card keeps the two doors whose words name it, Settings,
  help and guide's "Replay welcome tour" and the features browser's
  "Welcome tour" row.

- The Ask sub-tab shows each cited note once. Under the answer sat numbered
  source cards for the same five notes, with the same ids in the same order,
  that Matching records was already showing beside them; under the answer
  there is now one line, "Sources: 5 notes, on the right", which brings the
  column into view when pressed. A source the column does not hold, a file or
  a web page, keeps its card and its number. A citation mark now lights the
  records row for its note and shows the passage there, which is where that
  note is drawn on this tab. The Chat tab is unchanged: it has no column
  beside it, so its cards are the only place its sources can be.
- Find anything centres its text in its bar. The field carried the
  stacked-form `margin-bottom` every input in this app has, and the rule that
  turns off the field's border, ground and padding inside the band had not
  turned that off: `align-items: center` centres a flex item with its
  margins, so the field sat 4.8px above the middle with 1px of room above it
  and 11px below. The glyph beside it was dead centre the whole time, which
  is what made the text look dropped. Zeroed, and the bar takes the band's
  44px floor below 820, which it used to reach only by accident.
- The guided tour never draws its cut-out off the page. A step whose control
  was off the right edge clamped to a negative width, which is invalid CSS and
  is dropped, so the cut-out kept the previous step's size and sat outside the
  window: the dim is that element's own box-shadow, so the page went dark with
  a bright band where the shadow's edge fell and nothing highlighted. Measured
  at 2000x1140 with the target at x 3000: the cut-out placed at 2994 carrying
  708px of stale width. A step whose control is not really on screen is now
  dropped, the counter renumbers, and a cut-out that cannot be drawn is not
  drawn at all, with the card centred instead. The tour sweep drives the
  welcome flow's own hand-off at 2000x1140, 1440 and 390 and asserts a visible
  card and an on-screen cut-out on every step.
- The split document view lines its panes up from rects, not `offsetTop`.
  The first fix mapped source lines to rendered blocks correctly and then read
  each block's position with `offsetTop`, which is measured from the nearest
  positioned ancestor rather than from the pane: measured on a real document,
  every block's `offsetTop` ran 218px past its true offset in the pane at
  1440 and 230px at 1024, and collapsing the sidebar changed the bias to
  146px by putting a positioned element in between. Every anchor carried that
  constant, so the preview parked that far past the line the source was
  showing, at every position. The probe that closed the first report read
  `offsetTop` too, so the same bias cancelled on both sides of its
  subtraction and it reported 0px from a pane a paragraph and a half out.
  Measured with rects: worst 444px at 1440 and 453px at 1024 before, 1px
  after, across ten passes covering both directions, a mid-document edit, a
  view switch, a save and the sidebar moving.
- The split document view keeps its two panes on the same place. The sync
  was a scroll fraction, which is exact at both ends and wrong in between
  wherever a block takes a different amount of room in the two halves: a
  picture is one line of source and four hundred pixels of preview, and every
  such block shifts everything below it in one pane only. Measured on a
  five-section document with a table, a code fence and a list in each, the
  preview sat 282, 292, 266, 404 and 550px away from the heading the source
  was showing, growing downwards. `renderMarkdown` now stamps every block
  with the source line it came from and the sync interpolates between the
  nearest pair of anchors: 0, 75, 0, 0, 0px, and the 75 is the editor landing
  21px short of where it was asked to scroll.
- The guide panel says it is the guide, and its thinking box can now be
  drawn. The head reads "Atlas guide" over one muted line, "How this app
  works, from its own help text", and the sheet's accessible name is that
  same string. The streamed turn runs in a preset of its own
  (`presets.GUIDE_MODE`, Quick's brevity and temperature) rather than
  `quick`, whose `think: False` told every reasoning model not to think:
  `.help-chat-think` was drawing an event that could not arrive. Which model
  the panel takes is now pinned by tests in all three cases, because
  `utility_model()` answers the chat model when smart model routing is off
  and when no utility model has been chosen.
- The guided tour switches to its step's tab and waits for the control to
  arrive, leaves that control pressable, and carries a visible way out. The
  dim was one layer across the window, so `elementFromPoint` at the centre of
  all fifteen steps answered the dim and not the control; it is now four
  panels around the cut-out, and the hole belongs to the page. A step that
  navigates waits up to 1.5s of frames for its target rather than dropping it
  on the first frame after `switchTab` resolves, which is why steps inside a
  tab used to vanish and the tour looked as though it never moved. The card's
  head gained a close X beside the counter; Skip and Escape still end the same
  run.
- The Guide streams its answer on a locked notebook. The streaming fetch sent
  no session token, so it was refused and the panel fell back quietly to the
  one-shot route: the reply arrived in one piece, and "streaming is broken"
  was the honest report. A lint now fails on any hand-rolled fetch to a locked
  route that forgets the header.
- "What does Performance mode do?" has an answer. The setting existed and the
  help text did not, so the Guide was told to say it was not sure.
- A document's AI edit reported the model as running when it was not: the
  route compared the note against a constant the offline message stopped
  being.
- A failure now names its way out. DuckDuckGo rate-limiting goes looking for
  a SearXNG on this machine and uses it if there is one, and says where the
  one-press install is if there is not. An embedding model that is selected
  but never downloaded says so, with the button and the command to get it,
  rather than a raw 404.

- A surface whose data did not arrive now says so, with a way to try again,
  instead of drawing its empty state. Measured with every request failing:
  the notes list, the map, the timeline and the library each claimed the
  notebook was empty, and the dashboard's tiles printed "0 this week" and
  "0 day streak" from figures they had not read.

- Alignment guides now appear when a selection is dragged by a sketch. Cards
  have had them for a while; the sketch drag was the one that never asked for
  them, so any group that happened to include a drawing had none.

- A skill run is no longer cut short on a local model. Its token allowance is
  per step rather than per run, and there is no wall-clock limit out of the
  box: a nine-step skill measured on a 4B model reached step three after
  twenty three minutes, and a ninety second budget had already ended it.

- The graph minimap is hidden when there is nothing to map, rather than
  sitting empty in the corner under the top bar.

- The Ask tab keeps its inline citation markers. A live-render paint armed
  before the stream ended fired after the markers were placed and repainted
  the answer from raw markdown, so the numbers appeared and vanished within a
  frame.

- The resurfacing ranking no longer fails when it is asked for the notes near
  a particular one. It read the embedding column by the wrong name, in a loop
  nothing had ever entered.

- The Windows launchers are checked out with CRLF again. cmd.exe seeks a
  batch label by byte offset and its scanner expects CRLF, so in an LF-only
  file every `call :label` landed mid-line: reported from a real install as
  "The system cannot find the batch label specified - bail_if_cancelled"
  between steps 1 and 2 of setup, which meant answering "no" to the
  installer did nothing at all. A `.gitattributes` rule and a lint.

- The desktop window opens about a second and a quarter sooner. Starting the
  app used to import the whole server, FastAPI and SQLAlchemy included,
  before it had read its own command line: 1,203ms of the 1,210ms it took to
  load the entry module. That now happens on the server thread, behind the
  window instead of in front of it, which is also why the packaged build
  looked like it had no splash.

- Board and map previews no longer draw over themselves. Blocks are kept
  inside the thumbnail, a caption's width is measured rather than estimated,
  and a caption that would land on another block or another caption is moved
  or left out. It also finds room for more titles than before, not fewer.

- Headings in the rendered document view are the size they should be. A
  document's biggest heading was drawn smaller than its body text, and two
  levels of heading were identical, because the tags the renderer uses had
  no styling at all. Both views of a document now use the same scale.

- Lists render in the documents live view, which drew them as plain text:
  bullets and numbers now hang in the margin with their text aligned under
  itself, nesting is visible, and a dash is drawn as a bullet unless the
  caret is on its line. A task's checkbox no longer makes its own line
  taller than every other line in the document.

- A group selection on a whiteboard can be resized and rotated. All eight
  handles and the rotate dot were drawn but sat under the card layer, so six
  of the nine could not be pressed. The outline also travels with the group
  while it is dragged, instead of staying where the items started.

- Line numbers in a document stop colliding around a fenced code block.

- Ctrl+S saves your preferences, which the screen has promised for a long
  time without anything doing it, and says so with a toast. Preferences is
  the only settings section that does not save on its own, and now says that
  too: once at the top, and again on the button as soon as you change
  something.

- "What it learned" uses the same switch rows as the rest of Settings. Every
  row's name ran straight into its hint ("Night shiftReads notes you have
  added or changed") because the rows were built from a different recipe.

- Close, download and tick marks are drawn with the app's own icon set
  instead of typed characters, so they match the icons beside them in face,
  size and weight.

- The document editor's ⋯ menu is shorter and stays on screen. Its five
  "Download as" rows and "Print or save as PDF" are one "Download or print"
  row now, opening the same side flyout the notes list's ⋯ menu already uses
  (an accordion at phone width, where there is nowhere for a flyout to go).
  The menu was 706px tall in a 900px window; it is 562px. Separately, these
  menus were only ever clamped vertically: at 390px wide the document ⋯ sat
  53px off the left edge of the screen, with no way to scroll to the start of
  its labels. They are clamped on both axes now.

- A search in what the notebook learned counted rows it was not showing, so
  the table's pager offered pages that were not there. The page and the
  count are narrowed by one function now.

- The graph's minimap no longer writes "NaN" into the viewport rectangle.
  Measured intermittently on a four thousand note notebook: 112 console
  errors in one sweep, all of them `<rect> attribute x: Expected length,
  "NaN"` and the same for y, width and height. Captured at the write, the
  zoom transform itself held NaN while the dimensions and every node
  position were finite. The minimap checks everything it reads now, and the
  three places the app builds a zoom transform refuse to build one out of a
  number that is not one: `Math.min`/`Math.max` propagate NaN rather than
  clamping it, so the scale clamps that looked like guards were not.

- The app calls its AI by name. Atlas was the name in the chat sheet and in
  the prompts, and everywhere else the interface still said "the AI": 68
  strings across eight files and 41 pieces of markup, including the Models
  screen, which read "Active: qwen2.5:7b" and now reads "Atlas, running
  qwen2.5:7b". Copy that means the model or the runtime rather than the
  librarian still says so. `AI_NAME` moved to app.js, the first script the
  page loads, so a string anywhere can read it; a new lint fails the build on
  copy that calls it "the AI" again.

- Four helpers in `documents.js` that no feature called are gone, and the
  tests that covered them now cover what the app runs instead. The table pair
  demonstrated byte-exact cell writes through a writer nothing reached (a cell
  is edited by typing into the source line); the columns test asserted a
  template the "/" menu does not insert; the frontmatter one asserted a
  flattened shape the properties panel never sees. About 120 lines of
  documents.js and three test sections, replaced by checks on cell spans,
  the caret the Tab key computes, the ghost-cell fill the editor really calls,
  and the columns string read straight out of `MD_ACTIONS`.

- A keyboard user is told what the dashboard's activity heatmap is. The grid
  scrolls horizontally, and Chromium gives every scroll container a tab stop
  so it can be scrolled with the arrow keys, so Tab landed on a bare `div`
  that a screen reader announced as nothing. It now carries a role and a name
  ("Activity over the last year, N notes"). Found by walking the tab order,
  which is now a sweep (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/keyboard.js`, in the gate's
  `--sweeps` set): it presses Tab across all seven tabs and fails on a stop
  that is invisible, unnamed, or reordered by a positive `tabindex`.

- The whiteboard works again. A change that came in from outside the project
  ran a regular expression over `whiteboard.js` to move the board's undo
  history onto the app's stack and deleted ten live functions along with the
  two it meant to replace, among them `wbItemTransform`, which is what
  positions every card on the board. The board threw on its first render and
  drew nothing. That commit is reverted; the three parts of it that were right
  are re-applied below.

- No console window blinks over the packaged Windows app. It is a GUI process,
  so every console tool it runs in the background (`docker`, `pip`,
  `tesseract`, `winget`) was given a real console window by Windows, shown and
  torn down. Every spawn now asks for `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, and a lint fails the
  build when a new one forgets.

- Tesseract installed on Windows is found even when PATH does not mention it.
  The installers do not reliably add themselves, and the per-user mode never
  does, so the app told people who had just installed Tesseract to install
  Tesseract. It now reads the installer's registry key first, then the standard
  Program Files and LOCALAPPDATA locations, and points `pytesseract` at what it
  finds.

- A note's text stays inside its card on a board. A card could not shrink its
  text below the box the person dragged it to, so the paragraphs were laid out
  past the border and painted over the board; and whether a note got a "Show
  more" was decided by its character count rather than by whether it fitted.

- A card left open on a board is still open when the board is opened again.

- An exported board carries what its cards are showing. Every card's label was
  cut to 160 characters and six lines whatever the card's size, so an expanded
  note exported as six lines. The export dialog now also says when collapsed
  notes are keeping text out of the picture.

- A fenced code block in the Live view no longer has an empty row above and
  below it. The fence lines keep the block's tint and take the height of
  padding, and the language is drawn in the block's corner.

- Three calls to functions that no file defines: the semantic search toggle
  (`loadAllNotes`), every Conversations row in the command palette
  (`loadChatHistory`), and opening a note from a mind map node
  (`openEntryEditor`).

### Changed

- The note list repaints four times while a big notebook loads instead of once
  per page: measured on four thousand notes, `loadEntries()` goes from about
  1.8 s to 0.9 s and hands back three quarters of a second of main thread.

- The settings search reads each section's text once and remembers it, instead
  of rebuilding and lowercasing 63 KB on every keystroke.

- The Docker daemon is probed at most once every fifteen seconds, rather than
  on every status poll with an eight second timeout.
- MemoryMap introduces itself with a guided tour: a small card at a time,
  anchored to the control it is describing, over a page dimmed everywhere
  except that control, with back, next, skip, and a "3 of 7" counter. It comes
  in four short sections (the basics, writing a note, finding things, boards
  and maps); a first run is offered the basics alone, and Settings, help and
  guide replays the whole thing or any one section. Escape leaves it, focus
  goes back where it came from, and it never opens by itself once it has been
  finished or skipped. The welcome that used to describe seven tabs from the
  middle of the screen is now two cards, the greeting and the setup check, and
  hands over to the tour.
- One-click recovery. When start.sh or start.bat's normal launch fails for a
  reason it can fix (no working interpreter in .venv, or a dependency the
  app can't import), it repairs itself once, automatically, with no prompt,
  says in one line what it did, and carries on; a repair that doesn't fix
  it says exactly what is wrong and where the log is, and never loops. The
  Windows installer gained a "Repair MemoryMap AI" shortcut beside the
  ordinary one, running the packaged build's own repair (clears the cached
  window profile, then opens the app normally; notes and preferences are
  untouched).
- Printing a document prints the document. A plain Ctrl+P from the editor put
  the tab bar, the sidebar, the dock and the status bar on the page around the
  text; it now puts black ink on white paper with a reading column, and keeps
  a heading with the text it names, a code block and a quotation whole across
  a page break.

- The serif reading face gets a column of its own width. It is narrower than
  the app's own face, so the same column held 93 characters on a line where
  the default holds 76, which is past what is comfortable to read.

- The command palette carries the documents editor's own actions while a
  document is open, each with the keys that run it, and the keyboard shortcuts
  dialog gained a section listing the editor's chords. Both are built from one
  table, so they cannot disagree about what a key does.

- A section can be moved by dragging its heading in the outline, and the
  heading, its text and everything nested under it travel together. Alt with
  an arrow does the same from the keyboard, on the row that has focus.

- A document's outline folds and filters. A heading with sections under it
  carries a caret that hides them, remembered per document, and past ten
  headings a filter box appears above the list and says how many of them are
  showing.

- The Library's Documents list filters by a property a document declares about
  itself. A document that opens with `status: draft` or `tags: [one, two]` can
  now be found by that, from one control beside the search box that offers only
  the properties the documents on screen actually have, with a count each.

- The formatting strip above a document, and the matching one in the note
  editor, light up under the pointer the way every other bar in the app does.
  A hovered button wore an accent tint and a solid accent rim, so a hand
  crossing twenty-seven controls lit each one in the colour this app uses to
  mean "on".

- The writing panel's answers are reachable from the keyboard. Pressing Enter
  on a row now puts focus on the first suggestion, Escape hands it back to the
  row, and a press with the pointer still leaves the caret in the document
  where the word was just shown.

- The outline marks the section you are writing in, not the one at the top of
  the window. Typing in a section lower down the page left the heading above it
  marked until the view happened to scroll. Scroll far enough that the caret
  leaves the editor and the top of the view takes over again.

- The Word (.docx) export is a button in Settings, optional extras. Without
  python-docx the export answered with the name of a package and nowhere to
  get it, which in an app that asks for no terminal is a dead end.

- Typing into a box that is not a text field no longer triggers the app's
  single-key shortcuts. A "/" typed while correcting a page reading in the
  Library moved focus to the search box and swallowed the rest of the word.

- A passage selected in a document and sent to the chat is re-checked against
  the document you are looking at. It was checked against the empty textarea
  the editor leaves behind, so every document selection was described to the
  model as "the user has since edited it, so this passage may no longer be
  there" while the passage was on screen.
- The graph's display options fit their panel again. Physics, Groups and
  Minimap are the three sections you set once and leave, so each is now a
  fold on the app's own `details.settings-fold` recipe, closed by default and
  remembered once you open it. Measured at 1440x900: 655px of list in a 488px
  box, scrolling, before; 451px in 451px, not scrolling, after. At 1024 the
  same 451 in 451. At 390 the panel still scrolls, as it did, but with 795px
  of list where the same panel held 1071.
- Notes → Write with AI is a writing desk. Its head is a dock on the app's
  own grammar (identity, one Draft button, Stop, Undo, a '?' and a kebab)
  where it used to be a heading and a lone round '?' over a card with two
  filled buttons. Five quick-start chips stand where an empty pair of boxes
  used to; under the thoughts box, three pickers say what to write, in what
  voice and at what length, and an adder hands Atlas up to six of your own
  notes to write from.

- The draft arrives as it is written, with the thinking shown while it runs.
  It used to appear in one piece once the model had finished: measured
  against a stand-in model server, 22.9 seconds and one write of the box
  before, first text in under a fifth of a second and one write per chunk
  after. A pass that fails or is stopped hands back the draft that went in.

- Five things to ask for rather than one: draft a note, carry on writing,
  rewrite it in another voice, open bullets out into prose, close prose back
  into bullets. Tone and length are pickers, not something to phrase.

- What to do with a finished draft is one row: copy it, insert it into a note
  you already have, or save it as a note. Inserting leaves you at the desk
  with your draft, and offers the trip to the note rather than taking it.
  Every draft the session produced is a chip you can go back to, beside the
  undo that was already there.

- A note you already have can be carried on: it comes into the draft, and
  saving writes back to that note rather than filing a second copy of it.

- With no model connected the writing desk says so in a line you can act on,
  with the button that connects one, rather than only in a tooltip on a
  button that cannot be pressed.
- The Timeline's table keeps its title column on a tablet. Between 600 and
  1024 pixels wide the fixed columns took everything and the title, the one
  thing that says which note a row is, was squeezed to nothing and the table
  scrolled sideways. The space and the two counts now give way at that width,
  and the tags below 820.

- The Timeline's density strip appears when it has a shape to draw rather than
  when the notebook passes a note count. It used to hide a real profile (a
  hundred and fifty notes spread over ten months) and show a row of identical
  marks (two hundred notes written in a fortnight).

- A skill can say what "it worked" means, and the app checks it. Settings →
  Skills has a "Check it worked" row: pick a counting tool, what the number
  should be afterwards, and whether to count only the notes with no tags. The
  built-in "Auto-tag my notes" now claims what it actually promises, that no
  note is left untagged, and the two audit skills that could not be checked at
  all now report that they changed nothing. A skill saved from Settings used to
  lose its check on the way to the server without saying so.

- Counting your notes can be narrowed the way listing them always could:
  `count_notes` takes "untagged" and a time window, so a skill can ask the
  notebook a smaller question instead of paging through all of it.

- A citation names the note a sentence actually came from. Which note is now
  decided by the best passage in the answer's own candidate set rather than by
  how many words the note shares with the sentence, so a long note that carries
  a claim's words spread through paragraphs about other things no longer earns a
  second mark beside the note that says the thing. Measured on sixteen fixture
  questions (`tests/fixtures/chat/grounding_cases.json`): 18 of 18 sentences
  cited to the right note, up from 17 of 18, with no mark at all on a sentence
  the notes do not support.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-14

- The status bar's help button says "Guide", not the assistant's name. It sat
  beside "Ask" reading "Atlas", so the bar offered two buttons that both mean
  "talk to the AI" and neither said which knows your notes and which knows the
  app. The name is in the tooltip, which also survives renaming the persona.

- A placed note that is showing its whole text sizes to the text. It kept the
  height it was saved at, so "Show more" ran a long note out through the bottom
  edge of its own card.

- A mind map node's icon grows with the node's own text instead of staying at
  the size it started at, and the text-size and resize grips moved off the
  corner where the add buttons hang.

- The chat's Resume and Edit-step buttons survive reopening a conversation.
  They were built from the live stream's own variables, so a run you stopped
  offered to carry on until you changed tab.

- The Ask tab's citation markers, its "Grounded in" chips and its Sources panel
  are numbered together, from one list, and the grounding is drawn once against
  the finished answer rather than into prose that is still streaming.

- The timeline's "Start today's note" opens the composer with the date in the
  title instead of writing an empty note on the press.

- A shape swept up by the selection rectangle shows its selection box and its
  eight anchors, and double tapping an anchor fits a note, text box or sticky
  to its text.

- A run that stops on its budget says where the setting is.

- The chat welcome's '?' moves to its top right corner, out of the middle of
  the sentence it was in, and it opens: the welcome is built after boot, so its
  help trigger had never been wired to anything (INBOX 236).

- The popup agent's suggested questions are rows, not pills. Fourteen bordered
  buttons in two ruled columns are now quiet rows with no edge at rest, the
  family glyph in a quieted accent, a ground that arrives with the pointer, and
  one column below 480px (INBOX 231).

- The document dock's ⋯ menu stays inside the window. Its panel was capped by
  a flat share of the window height rather than by the room under the button,
  so at 1440x700 it ran 114px past the bottom edge with its last row out of
  reach; it is now capped to the room it has, scrolls inside that, and opens
  upward when there is less than 240px below (INBOX 233).

- The kebab menus open on top of the surface they belong to. An escaped ⋯
  menu sat at z-index 1020, chosen when the only thing it opened over was a
  dialog at 1010, so the popup agent's foot menu drew behind the command
  palette at 2000 and looked like a button that does nothing (INBOX 230). The
  tier is now above every overlay a kebab can appear on.

- Atlas's answer badges that name a Settings section now open it. The
  delegated click handler matched `[data-goto-tab]` only, so the "Web search"
  and "Skills" badges under a help answer did nothing while "Chat" worked
  (INBOX 234).

- An Ask answer keeps its citations. `ask_turns` stores the sentence-level
  grounding it was written with, and a turn reopened from the history panel
  draws the same numbered in-text references, "grounded in" chips and source
  cards the live answer had (INBOX 241).
- The Writing Room's two boxes keep their height when you click into them: the
  editor's wrapper takes over the stretching the textarea was doing, so neither
  box drops 184px on its first focus (INBOX 240).
- A table in full view can be closed: an X in the panel's head that names
  Escape, focus handed back to the button that opened it, and the ⋯ menu's
  Back row lifted above the panel it was drawing behind (INBOX 239).
- The agent hand-off files are one ledger: `docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/OPEN.md`
  carries every still-open item from the 38 finished files, by surface, with the
  file, the id and the next step, and those files move whole to
  `docs/roadmap/archive/agent-remaining/` (INBOX 220).
- Aurora's trails end and its ring no longer stamps itself into them (INBOX
  210). The Library's Create chooser is a column of named rows like the
  documents' template dialog (211).
- The notebook's AI is called Atlas. One constant, `memorymap.ai.AI_NAME`, and
  one clause at the head of the three prompts that speak as the app: the chat
  and Ask librarian, the agent, and the in-app help chat. A theme, not a
  persona: no backstory, no tone instructions, and a persona the user wrote is
  left exactly as they wrote it. The untrimmable prose went down rather than
  up, from 52 characters to 41, because the clause is shorter than the
  sentence it replaced.

- The launchers obey the update settings. `start.sh` and `start.bat` ran
  `git pull --ff-only` on every launch of a git checkout whatever Settings
  said, so both switches in Settings, About were half true: "Update
  automatically" turned off still updated the code on the next launch, and
  "Stable (tagged releases)" still followed whatever branch was checked out.
  Both now read `auto_update_enabled` and `update_channel` out of
  `preferences.json` before anything else happens: off does nothing and ticks
  the step "Off in Settings", main fast-forwards the branch as before, and
  stable fetches the tags and fast-forwards to the newest release tag only.
  Both paths stay `--ff-only`, so neither can rewrite local work. A source
  checkout defaults to on, which is what it has always done.
- The first launch of a fresh install sometimes did nothing at all. `set -e`
  plus `set -o pipefail` plus a log rotation whose glob matched nothing yet,
  because the `tee` that creates the log runs in the background, ended
  `start.sh` with exit code 2 and an empty terminal. Measured at 2 failures in
  10 brand new data directories before, 30 clean runs after. The doctor also
  now recognises a `git worktree` checkout, where `.git` is a file rather than
  a directory, which `start.bat` already did.

- The tests that never ran anywhere now run in CI. The unit job installs node,
  so the nine tests that shell out to `node --check` and the plain markdown and
  export scripts stop skipping themselves, and a new `pdf` job installs the
  rasteriser extra (`pypdfium2`, `Pillow`), asserts `pdfpages.available()` and
  runs the ten files gated on it. Measured with the extra present: 159 tests in
  those files, none skipped.

- Nine failures that said nothing now say it at debug. The `except Exception:
  pass` handlers in the embedding enrichment (4), the entity pass, the vision
  read, the two PDF page closes and the task history each log with `exc_info`
  and name what was being attempted; `entities.py` and `taskhistory.py` had no
  logger at all to say it through, and now do. None of the handlers widened.

- The graph and timeline routes name their optional parts. `graph` was 355
  lines and 58 branches and is 227 and 29, with the three opt-in blocks as
  `_add_entity_nodes`, `_add_document_nodes` and `_add_map_edges`; `timeline`
  was 346 and 53 and is 248 and 39, with the three row builders as
  `_place_notes`, `_place_documents` and `_place_reminders`. No behaviour
  changed: 118 graph and mind map tests and 27 timeline tests pass either side.

- The chat stream route is a resolve and a stream, not one 424-line function.
  `chat_stream` is now 71 lines: what one call settles before it opens the
  stream is a `_StreamRequest` record, the no-tools path is `_plain_events`
  (149 lines) and the NDJSON writer is `_stream_lines` (219), both module-level
  rather than closures. No behaviour changed; 264 chat and skill tests pass.

- A skill run reads as a setup, a step and a finish. `_run_skill` was 682 lines
  and 82 branches; it is now 301 and 36, with one step's attempts, contract and
  paging in `_run_one_step` (401 lines), the run's decisions on a `_RunSetup`
  record and what it learns on a `_RunState`. No behaviour changed: the 88
  skills tests and the run, verifier and agent files pass either side.

- The agent's turn reads as three stages rather than one long one. `run_agent`
  was 875 lines and 68 branches by the same AST ruler the audit used
  (`scratchpad/probe_complexity.py`); it is now 279 and 37, with the setup in
  `_prepare_turn` (248 lines), one tool call and its guards in `_dispatch_call`
  (405), and the ledgers the rounds share on a `_TurnState` record. No
  behaviour changed: the same 306 agent, chat and skill tests pass before and
  after.

- The agent knows how big its model is. `run_agent` now asks
  `model_manager.is_small_model` about the model it is actually going to call,
  the same predicate the skills path uses, and a small model gets the core
  tools without the orchestration three, the short descriptions, and four
  rounds rather than six plus six earned. Measured on one turn with a 32k
  window: 11 tools and 3,828 schema bytes against 56 and 27,250. A model whose
  name does not say its size is left alone.

- Background work is bounded. Every upload used to spawn up to three threads of
  its own (Tesseract, the caption, the vision read) plus a document read, so a
  folder of 200 pictures was 600 threads against one Tesseract and one local
  model. `core/jobs.py` is now one pool with two lanes: the CPU lane is the core
  count capped at four, the model lane is one worker, and every
  `*_in_background` enqueues on it. The activity panel lists what is queued, and
  shutdown drops the queue inside a deadline instead of draining it.

- Boot is lighter: p5 (1 MB, decoration only) loads in idle time on first use
  rather than as a blocking script, and the dashboard's seven widgets share one
  `/insights/stats` fetch (44 boot fetches to 35). The graph, documents,
  whiteboard and library code now arrives on the first visit to the tab that
  needs it rather than before anything draws: 8 scripts and 1,072 KB at boot,
  from 13 and 1,699. Boot also stopped asking for the same thing twice:
  preferences once rather than four times, the graph once rather than three
  times, the board list and the note list once each, and the notes list's
  first page is 200 notes rather than the whole notebook. The audit these came
  from is WORLD_CLASS_PLAN "Audit, 2026-09-13 night" (INBOX 209).

### Fixed

- A note's keyboard-focus ring and label on the graph end when the
  keyboard leaves the map, a pointer takes over or the popup closes, so
  Labels off means off (INBOX 263). The trace's path box has inner padding.
- The graph trace's result panel has the dock's padding, so a one-line
  result is no longer a strip the height of its text (INBOX 262).
- A file chip in a note's body has room below it before the badges row
  (INBOX 261).
- The dashboard greeting's persona select no longer draws empty when the
  saved name is the built-in's old one or a persona since deleted (INBOX
  260).
- The embedding model's warm-up waits for the app to go quiet after its
  first requests, so the dashboard's counts no longer load behind the
  torch import when you log in right after launch (INBOX 257).
- The packaged app still checks stable releases when "Track the main
  branch" is on (that switch is the source-install launchers'), and its
  label says so (INBOX 254).
- **The packaged Windows app starts again.** It is built without a console,
  so `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` were None and uvicorn's log formatter
  failed on `sys.stderr.isatty()` before a port was bound: "Unable to
  configure formatter 'default'" on launch, and an auto-update into such a
  build left the app unopenable. Both streams now go to
  `<data dir>/logs/desktop-stdio.log` first (INBOX 251). The release
  workflow now starts the frozen app and waits for its page before it
  packages or uploads it, on both platforms; `--reset-password` no longer
  needs a console to confirm.
- Circles on the whiteboard can be moved, resized and rotated again, alone
  or in a marquee selection: their path is written with absolute arcs,
  which neither the bounding-box walk nor the transform walk read (INBOX
  252, 255).
- The built-in librarian persona is Atlas; a preference saved under the old
  name keeps working (INBOX 237). The help page's Ask Atlas row has room
  above it and the Advanced response settings sit above Installed models
  (INBOX 235). The graph's Curved links and Cluster glow switches are what
  the renderer reads, so the menu cannot show one thing and draw another
  (INBOX 247). The empty chat's '?' sits in the pane's corner, not the
  welcome column's (INBOX 248).
- A Library row's preview is plain words: wiki links read as their titles,
  table rules, list markers and pipes are gone, and a bold marker the clip
  split no longer survives (INBOX 244). The Create picker is sized to its
  five rows rather than the 880px modal width (INBOX 245).
- The graph's node popup opens with its body rendered again (headings,
  bold, pictures), and the capture box, the edit form and the draft get the
  note editor on their first focus from a fresh boot: the editor's bundle
  became Library-only when the tabs went lazy, so nothing mounted until
  that tab had been visited; app.js now fetches it on the first focus of a
  note box and the popup mounts it on open (INBOX 242).
- Atlas's answer badges did nothing in the sheet (their click handler was
  delegated on the Settings modal); the sheet head now carries the mark,
  the name, the one-line description and the kebab beside the close, the
  composer's field and buttons share one 40px height, and answers are
  written in under the caret rather than dropped in whole.
- The Library's sub-tabs, the boards controls and the graph pane did not
  wire when their files loaded on first use: their top-level setup waited
  for `DOMContentLoaded`, which had already fired. They wire through
  `onDomReady` now, and a lint fails any lazy file that waits for the event.
- The dashboard's shared `/insights/stats` reader called itself instead of the
  endpoint, so every widget that reads the notebook's totals drew its empty
  state and no request was made at all. Each of the seven call sites has a
  `catch`, which is why nothing showed in the console.

- The mind map's control sweep is closed (INBOX 200): 112 controls audited, one
  place per action, the top bar 60 controls to 40 and the ring's reach 164px to
  88px, with every ring action also a key and also in the topic's own menu.
- The mind map's own sweep reads the map it draws: the last two failures in
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mindmap.js` were its own sampling, a fixed 64 points
  along a path whose spacing grows with the edge. One sample per pixel, on the
  edge belonging to the pair being measured, and the gap after a drag is 0px.
  76/76, from 74/76.
- An empty mind map now says how to start, once for the browser: one line under
  the template offer pointing at the topic's own ring and at Tab, gone the
  moment a map has more than its root. The map's rail carries a '?' that names
  all three surfaces and the keys behind them (INBOX 200).
- A mind map's core idea is told apart four ways at once (INBOX 201): the
  ellipse, a ground filled in its own branch colour with the ink that reads on
  it, one step larger type and a star before the label, all from the one toggle
  in the strip. The ink is computed per colour, so the label clears 4.5:1 on
  every palette entry in both themes (worst 4.62:1, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mapcore.js`,
  16 checks light and dark). A topic given a shape by hand keeps it.
- At a higher browser zoom the tab strip no longer runs under the header
  controls (1152 to 1240 measured at 0px overlap) and a mind map's top bar
  folds its picker and Library label from 1216px down (INBOX 195). A board
  export's description shows on its card at once (196). New board from inside
  a board pre-selects the last kind (197). The live view hides a code fence's
  backticks while the caret is elsewhere; the graph node popup opens rendered
  and no longer repeats the note's own pictures (198). Today's note is one
  press, one note, and jumps to it (199). Every sheet has a close button in
  its title row (204). The agent and the Guide leave the header for the
  bottom bar, which takes the header cluster from five buttons to three, and
  the header's icon buttons lose their segmented wells for the header's own
  ground (207). A help '?' popover is capped at a reading height and scrolls
  instead of running the height of the window, and stays inside the window on
  a phone (206), and opens in front of the popup agent rather than behind it
  (205). Switching light and dark is one repaint rather than a dissolve at
  three speeds, and the background art is rebuilt after it rather than during
  it (202). Every control that needs a model says so and is disabled while
  none is running, 15 of them rather than the 7 an array in one file had kept
  up with (203). The popup agent's foot row is one control high in every
  state rather than two or three lines of wrapped captions, 75px and 124px
  before, 51px and 61px now (208). Its starters read as a set: a glyph per
  verb family on all 14, labels left-aligned behind them, each family ruled
  off, and one line of intro rather than four (205). The in-app guide is called
  Atlas, can say what it is and what it cannot see, shows that before the first
  question, and reads as a column rather than a 1356px line (204). The
  Timeline's four kind filters are one dropdown that says what it is set to,
  441px of dock row down to 121px, so they no longer collide with the controls
  beside them at 150% zoom (214). A conversation with the popup agent can be
  kept: "Save as chat" in its foot menu writes it to the Chat tab and offers
  the thread (215). Atlas is one chat rather than two: a sheet on the popup
  agent's recipe with a head, starters, bubbles and a composer, the source help
  topics under each answer, and the Settings page holding the way in rather
  than a second copy of the box (224). Atlas is offered where the question
  comes up: a line under eleven help popovers, in three empty states, as a
  palette command, and as Ctrl+Shift+H, all from one table (224). The command
  palette stopped rendering results after the first keystroke until the Library
  had been opened once.

- The mind map has one place per action (INBOX 200). The node ring is six slots that say what they are, not eight icon-only discs; the topic strip holds every look, including the line shapes that were on the line ring; the dock holds what acts on the map. The ring and the strip are never open together, every ring slot is also a key, and the topic's own menu (the ring's More, or Shift+F10) carries all of it. A map no longer shows the board's Insert and Arrange menus: 60 controls in its top bar before, 40 after.

### Added

- Atlas can be stopped: while a question is out the send button is Stop,
  and a click aborts the request or halts the reveal where it is (INBOX
  259).
- A custom persona may write `{ai_name}` for the assistant's name; the
  Personas page says so beside the box, and the preview shows the filled
  text (INBOX 258).
- A report by email: every error toast has Report this, which saves the
  support bundle and opens your mail app addressed to the developer with
  the error in the message; Settings, Logs has Email the support bundle in
  its menu; and Atlas points
  a question about an error the same way (INBOX 256).
- The `m` chord reaches both assistants: `m` then `a` opens Atlas, `m` then
  `p` the popup agent (INBOX 249). A link out of any overlay closes that
  overlay first (INBOX 250).
- The night pass reads what it already knows in one query instead of one per
  note. Measured on a re-run with nothing new to derive: 9 statements over 5
  notes and 44 over 45 before, flat after.

- `scratchpad/probe_list_queries.py` drives every list endpoint at a page of 5
  and a page of 100 over the same notebook and says which ones cost a query
  per row. None do, measured at 121 notes with 40 attachments; the three
  newest and most joined are pinned in `tests/test_scale_query_counts.py` so
  the next one cannot arrive quietly.

- The journal has a day that opens twice. `POST /entries/daily/{date}` returns
  that day's note and makes it only if it is not there yet, so pressing
  "today's note" a second time no longer leaves two notes headed with the same
  date and the day's writing split between them. `GET /entries/daily` says
  which of the last days were written and how many in a row, counting back
  from the caller's own today and allowing today to still be empty.

- The guard that refuses to fetch a URL pointing back at this machine is one
  function now, `core.security.public_addresses`, rather than a private one
  inside the web reader. A new test walks `src/` for outbound HTTP calls and
  fails on a module that is not written down as either untrusted (it must go
  through the guard) or configured (the address is one the person set).

- Four list endpoints that returned as many rows as the notebook has now take
  a `limit`: the attachment gallery, the memory stream, the orphan scan and
  the duplicate groups. Each still reports the real total, so a screen that
  says "42 files nothing points at" is not counting its own page.
  `tests/test_list_limits.py` walks every route the app serves and fails on a
  fifth, with an allowlist that carries the reason each bounded list is
  bounded rather than a count.

- What the notebook learned, as a table you can correct (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15,
  I1 and I9). A night pass reads each note, keeps the claims it makes and the
  questions it leaves open, and records for every one of them the note and the
  exact span it came from, who decided (a model by name, or `local`), when and
  how sure. Each can be edited (and is then never overwritten by a later run),
  deleted (and then never re-derived), reset to what the model said, exported
  as JSON, or forgotten entirely, which leaves notes and revisions untouched.
  One switch per runner plus a master switch, read before every pass.
- A citation mark in a chat answer now shows the exact passage it came from on
  that source's card when hovered or focused, rather than only naming the note.

- The Guide is told which tab the question came from and what the controls on
  it are called, so "how does this work?" is answered about the surface in
  front of you rather than with "I'm not sure". It still cannot read a note:
  only control labels are sent, never text on screen.

- The popup agent and the help chat are reachable from every tab: a wand and a
  '?' in the header, and the '?' also sits in the head every Settings pane
  shares. The help chat has a name, the Guide, and opens as one shared sheet.
- The agent's starters now depend on the tab you opened it over, its arrow keys
  walk them, and its state line says what it is working on and which tool ran.

- Right-clicking or long-pressing a link now opens a menu with Copy link
  address and Open in new tab, anywhere a link is drawn. An internal
  `[[link]]` offers Copy title and Open instead.
- A dock zone that cannot shrink any further now says so instead of spilling
  its last control under the one beside it, and the dashboard's category rows
  are a target rather than 1.2px under the floor. The touch sweep also reads
  the floor off the band it is run in, so it says something true above 820
  rather than asserting a phone's 44px on a desktop.

- Every control on a phone is a 44px target, and a tab's title gets a line of
  its own there. Seven surfaces were walked whole rather than dock by dock:
  the Library and Reminders filter chips were 36px and 22.4px, the sidebar
  sheet's own opener 36px, the graph's zoom controls 34px, and the chat's
  title was 139px of text in a 56px box.

- Opening a picture card's fold no longer stretches the six cards beside it.
  It used to take every card in the row from 240.7px to 411.1px, leaving 213px
  of empty card under each of the others; now only the card you opened grows.
  The row is still equalised at rest, which is the recorded decision.

- On a tablet in landscape the header is one row again and the tabs are a
  finger's target. It was two rows (112px at 820) on the band whose own rule
  says one, with 36px tab buttons; the strip needed 505px against 448px of
  room. The buttons take the narrower padding and smaller caption the band
  below uses, a 44px floor on both axes instead, and the due-reminders count
  sits on its glyph rather than beside it. The strip is 385px in 448 and the
  header 72px.

- The phone's tab bar recedes to its icons while you read down a list and
  takes its words back the moment you turn round. It is never hidden: 57.6px
  of bar with captions becomes 44px of icons, still five columns and still
  44px targets. And the selected tab keeps its caption at 320, where it was
  the one column of five without a word.

- A sheet closes the same way wherever it is built. The three sidebars and
  the graph's panel become sheets in place rather than being built by the
  sheet recipe, and they now share its dismissal: a captured Escape, a press
  outside, and focus back on the control that opened it. The sidebar sheet's
  Escape used to bubble, so a handler inside the page that stopped one took
  it first.

- The timeline dock's kind filter is one control rather than four. The four
  kinds were four filter chips at four widths, which wrapped to three lines
  at 1024 and four at 820 and took the dock to 181.2px; they are a toggle
  set, so they are now a `.seg.seg-multi` well, one row at every width, the
  words in above 1200 and the icons alone below it, 44px cells on a phone.
  The band filter's way out is the one chip beside it, which is the one
  filter here you can take off. The dock is 54px at 1440, 1024 and 820.
- A document can leave with its pictures, as a Word file, and come back from
  one. "Download with images (.zip)" is the markdown plus every image it
  references in `assets/` with the links rewritten to match, so it opens with
  its pictures showing in any markdown reader; "Download as .docx" is a Word
  file where this install has python-docx, and a message naming the package
  where it does not. Importing a .docx now works without any converter
  installed (a Word file is a zip with one XML part in it), and a saved web
  page imports as prose rather than as tags. Measured:
  `tests/test_docexport_bundle.py` and `tests/test_docview_import.py` (14
  tests, 2 skipped without the optional extra), and
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docexports.js` in a browser, 6 of 6 with 0 unexpected
  console errors.

- Every note editor in the app is the same editor. The capture box, the note
  edit form, the graph's node popup and new-note box and the two Write-with-AI
  panes mount the document editor's engine on their first focus: markdown that
  renders as you write, the same Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I / Ctrl+E / Tab chords, the
  same "/" menu and the same toolbar, with the textarea still underneath as
  the value every save path reads and as the fallback if the engine cannot
  load. Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/notesurface.js`, 22 of 22 checks
  and 0 console errors: six boxes mounted, the typed text in the textarea
  under each, bold from the toolbar and from the keyboard, the "/" menu with
  14 commands in a note, and a script clearing the box clearing the view with
  it.

- A phone gets the formatting it can reach. Below 600px the documents editor
  carries a bar at the bottom edge with bold, italic, heading, list, task,
  link and the "/" menu, sized for a thumb and riding above the on-screen
  keyboard on the inset the app already measures. The 25-control strip at the
  top of the pane is still there for a wider window. Measured with
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docnarrow.js` at 390x820: 7 actions, the smallest
  target 44px, the bar's foot on the window's own edge, the last line of the
  document clear of it, bold writing `**first**` from a selection, the "/"
  button opening the 19-item insert menu, and the bar absent at 800, 1024 and
  1440.
- **Graph node popups draw the pictures and files a note names in its own
  markdown**, not only the ones it carries as attachments, and a file card
  states its size beside its kind. A note whose picture is a library upload
  opened a panel with nothing in it before; both shapes now draw. The graph
  also says what an entity is, in one sentence, in the Show section's help
  popover, in a legend entry and on the node itself.

- **A local map beside an open note or document** (GRAPH_PLAN Phase 4's last
  item). `#graph-pane` is the Graph tab's own canvas renderer at
  `size: "pane"`: it draws `/graph/local` at depth 1 for whatever is open, in
  the Notes sidebar and the Documents sidebar, and clicking one of its notes
  opens that note. Measured (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphpane.js`, 1440x950):
  6 nodes against the local payload's 6 where the tab has 74, a 226x176 box
  that really paints, and the tab's node count, edge count, canvas and camera
  size identical before and after.

- A document can be downloaded as one self-contained HTML file. Images become
  data URIs, the stylesheet is written into the file, comments travel as
  footnotes, controls that only work inside the app are dropped (a `[[link]]`
  keeps its words), and a link back into the app keeps its text without its
  address. Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docexporthtml.js`, which opens
  the saved file in a browser with every network request refused: 0 network
  attempts, 1 inline image decoded, the table, the task boxes and the reading
  measure all intact.

- A mind map's lines are styled one branch at a time. Select a topic and the
  strip carries the line coming into it: thin, normal or thick, dashed or
  solid, and an arrowhead on or off. The thickness scales the branch itself
  rather than a line width, so a thick branch is a wider ribbon at the parent
  and still tapers to its topic, and a thin one recedes. A trunk, which has no
  line above it, is shown none of these.

- A citation knows which passage of a note it came from. Grounding scored a
  sentence against a whole note, so a mark could only say "somewhere in here",
  which is no help on a note that mentions its subject in three paragraphs.
  Each mark now carries the span of the best-matching 40-word passage, scored
  with BM25 over the note's own passages, with the figures a claim quotes
  pulling the span towards the paragraph that holds them. The hover highlight
  that uses the span is the renderer's half and is not in yet.

- The phone's bottom bar is five columns instead of seven, and every one of
  them is named. Notes, Chat, Graph and Library are a tap away; Dashboard,
  Timeline, Reminders and Settings are behind More, which opens a sheet from
  the bottom of the screen. Nothing is hidden and nothing is more than two taps
  away. The bar also says where you are while you are on one of the three
  tabs behind More, which it could not before.

- Three ways to change what is in front of you while you write, in the
  document's ⋯ menu and remembered: "Dim all but this paragraph" fades every
  line outside the one you are in, "Keep this line centred" scrolls the pane so
  the line you are typing on stays in the middle, and "Serif for reading" draws
  the rendered page in a serif with a little more leading. Measured with
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docreading.js`: 40 of 41 lines at opacity 0.35 with the
  caret's paragraph at 1, the caret at 0.483 of the pane's height with the
  typewriter on against 0.956 without it, and the rendered page's line height
  24px to 27.52px with its text drawn 24.1px narrower, which is a different
  face rather than a different name for the same one.

- An AI edit arrives as a change you can take apart. The assistant's answer is
  shown as a diff against what it was asked to rewrite, one head per change,
  and any change can be skipped: skipping puts the old lines back rather than
  dropping them, and the text under the diff is always exactly what accepting
  would apply. Editing that text by hand rebuilds the diff against the same
  target. A pure insertion ("write") draws no diff, because a diff of an
  insertion is the insertion. Measured with
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docaidiff.js`: a two-change proposal draws two heads,
  skipping the second restores its original line in the answer and dims its two
  rows to 0.45, and putting it back restores the answer exactly.

- The bar down a mind map topic's edge is now the topic's own choice. The
  strip has a picker beside the shape: solid, dashed or no bar. The bar is what
  carries the branch's colour, so quieting it on a topic lets a dense map read
  as text rather than as a wall of colour, and a dashed one says "this one is
  provisional" without a second control. On a map that grows downward the
  choice moves to the top edge with the bar itself.

- The document history says what changed, not just when. Any version in a
  document's history opens a diff in its own row now: the lines it added and
  the lines it lost, in the app's two diff colours, with the untouched runs
  counted rather than printed, and a head saying which two versions are being
  compared. The list has an "AI edits" filter beside "All", so the versions an
  AI edit replaced can be found without reading past your own. Measured with
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/dochistory.js`: a one-line change in a forty-line
  document draws six rows and two counted gaps, and the history row itself came
  down from 346px to 94px, because a third action in the row had squeezed its
  text column to 134.6px and let a preview wrap to 270px.

- A mind map topic can be marked as a core idea. Beside bold and italic in
  the topic strip there is a crown now: a marked topic draws with a heavier
  outline, a wider spine in its branch's own colour and heavier type, so the
  idea a branch hangs off reads as that from across the canvas. The shape
  picker has gained the ellipse that goes with it, so a core idea can be a
  rounded card, a pill or an ellipse. The mark travels with a copied branch
  and "back to the branch" clears it with everything else.

- A mind map topic resizes like a card on a board. Point at a topic and there
  are two grips in its corner now: the "Aa" one that has always set the text
  size, and a new one that drags the topic itself wider and taller. The map's
  layout still owns where a topic sits, so a resize only ever changes its size,
  and the tidy pass makes room for the new one. The height it is given is a
  floor rather than a ceiling, so a topic can still never be cut off by its own
  words.

- A skill run that stops on a step can have that step rewritten and run on its
  own. Beside Resume there is now "Edit step N": change the wording, press Run
  this step, and only that step runs, with the earlier ones left alone and the
  rest of the skill still there to carry on with. The step's contract is not
  editable from there, so rewording an instruction cannot quietly drop the
  condition it has to meet.

- The Timeline is the whole notebook, not only its notes. Documents you
  started, boards you drew and reminders that fell due are rows in the feed
  and the table, each with its own marker, and four chips in the dock turn any
  of them off. A reminder sits on the day it is due, the way a note sits on a
  date it talks about; a document sits where it was started, so it does not
  walk forwards through the feed every time you open it.

- Today is always in the journal, even before you have written anything in it,
  and offers to start the day's note. The note is an ordinary note whose first
  line is the date, so it is searchable, it is in the graph, it exports, and a
  notebook opened in another editor still has it.

- A web link the AI writes on a line of its own now renders as a card: the
  link's own words as the title, the site under it, and the whole thing is the
  target rather than a few underlined characters. A link inside a sentence is
  unchanged, because a card in the middle of a sentence breaks the sentence.
  No favicon: this app fetches nothing from the web that you did not ask it
  to, and the site's name in words says the same thing.

- With no model connected, the app says so where you are and offers one click
  that fixes it. The Ask tab keeps working and explains that it is answering
  from your notes alone, with the matching records beside it; the popup agent,
  which has nothing to fall back on, disables its field and its starters
  rather than hiding them. Every AI-only button now says "Connect a model in
  Settings" instead of naming Ollama, which was the wrong instruction for the
  two other kinds of model this app can use.

- Twelve starters in the popup agent, grouped by what they do: capture, find,
  summarise, remind and do. Each is a verb with a slot ("Remind me to…") that
  drops into the box with the caret after it, or a whole instruction ("Tag my
  untagged notes.") that runs on the press; the three you used last are
  offered first. Beside them is "Use the open note", which sends whatever note
  or document you have open with what you ask, so "summarise this" works from
  a panel that floats over every tab. The card now has a ceiling and scrolls
  inside it, so Start over and Stop stay on screen on a laptop and a phone.

- The Ask tab answers the way the Chat tab does. Under an answer there is now
  a Sources disclosure listing what the answer drew on, an "Elsewhere in your
  notebook" row, and follow-up questions: press one and it is asked with the
  answer above it carried as context, so "when should I do that" resolves
  against what was just said instead of being read cold. All three are the
  Chat tab's own components drawing the same answer object, so an answer means
  the same thing whichever surface asked for it.

- Comments in a document. Select a phrase, choose Comment in the toolbar's
  Highlight menu or "Comment on this" in the "/" menu, and the remark is
  written into the document's own text as `==words== %%remark%%`: there is no
  comment store, so a document written in another editor arrives with its
  remarks already listed, and one written here stays readable anywhere else.
  The remark hides behind a pin in the text, the words it is about carry a
  hairline under the highlight, and the sidebar's Outline tab lists every
  remark with the phrase it is on: press one to jump to it, resolve one to
  take it out and leave the words. Read view shows the document without them;
  a PDF export carries them as footnotes.

- A context window per model. Settings > Models has a Context window box
  beside the model's spec: empty is auto (the window the model file or the
  server reports), a number is what that model runs at, and the choice is
  remembered per model, so a small model and a large one can differ. A
  hand-set window also beats the machine-wide ceiling, because that ceiling
  exists to stop the app guessing big, and a number typed for one named model
  is not a guess. The badge shows used against whatever window is in force.

### Fixed

- The mind map rail's layout picker was a 36px circle reading "T.": the
  rail's round tool-button rule caught the select's face. It fills its
  shell now, field-shaped.
- Local OCR pins Tesseract to one OpenMP thread unless `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT`
  is already set: measured 42 s against 0.28 s for one line of text in a
  four-core container, the thread oversubscription Tesseract's own docs
  warn about, which on a laptop beside a running model made every image
  read look hung.
- The generative background art did not appear after a fresh login:
  `startBgArt` returned early when p5 was not yet loaded, before its own
  on-demand branch. The early return is gone and the callback re-enters
  with the current prefs.
- Four dashboard widgets (Stats, Streak, Notebook constellation,
  Categories) read "Couldn't load this widget.": `fetchDashStats` called
  itself. A test pins the shape.
- The Rediscover widget's rows are one grid each: a one-line title over
  the reason and an icon-only Never again in a right column, so every row
  shares one shape (titles were 48, 24 and 72px tall with the control at
  three heights).
- `SpaceResponse`'s Pydantic V1-style `class Config: from_attributes = True`
  warned `PydanticDeprecatedSince20` on every request that returned a space.
  Moved to `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)`; it was the only
  class-based config left in the codebase (checked all 43 `BaseModel`
  subclasses). Verified with
  `pytest tests/test_api*.py tests/test_whiteboard.py tests/test_spaces.py
  tests/test_space_delete_cascades.py -W error::pydantic.warnings.PydanticDeprecatedSince20`,
  clean.
- The popup agent called a mind map or a board "the open note", and sent it to
  the model as a note, so an answer about a map you had just made described an
  entry whose whole content is its title. The toggle names the thing and its
  kind, and the run scopes to the board rather than to a note.

- The Actual size / Fit to panel toggle on an AI-written table did nothing
  outside full view: every rule it drove was scoped to the full-view panel. It
  works in the answer bubble now, and in full view the column widths and row
  heights can be dragged, with the sizes kept for as long as the answer is.

- The table bar under an AI-written table was five labelled buttons, which
  wrapped onto two rows inside the popup agent. It is one Copy button and a
  kebab menu holding Copy as markdown, Save as a note, Save as CSV and the two
  view toggles.

- The chat header's context-window badge drew the subline's separator dot
  inside its own pill, so the number sat 9.2px right of the pill's centre and
  the amber border past 70% of the window wrapped the dot as well as the
  count. The separator now sits in the gap beside the pill.

- The popup agent showed a blinking write caret beside the three-dot waiting
  animation, before any of the answer had arrived. The answer box wore
  `is-streaming` from the moment the request went out, so the caret's
  `> :last-child::after` arm landed on the dots; the class now goes on with
  the first token, which is what the Ask box has always done.
- The document assistant's Edit / Write / Remove row is drawn as the choice
  control it is. It carried a 11.2px track corner and a 6px segment corner
  where every other choice control on the same screen is 15.4px, and its three
  segments were 73.4 / 82.7 / 101.2px wide, so the widest verb read as the
  important one. The track takes `.seg`'s own radius, the segment sits
  concentric inside it at 10.4px, the three are one width (101.2px each) on a
  grid, the chosen one keeps `--accent-surface` behind `--on-accent`, a
  keyboard focus is visible on the segment for the first time, and what the
  three verbs do is behind the row's new '?' rather than above the field.
  Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/aiedit.js`, light and dark: seams 2.4px
  against a 2.4px gap, ends 5px and 5px, chosen segment 20.98:1 light and
  7.5:1 dark.

- The Live view drew a markdown table as a row of squeezed columns with wide
  empty gaps between them, and every cell wrapped its words one or two to a
  line. Each hidden pipe leaves three zero-width elements behind in the line
  (two CodeMirror widget buffers and the replacement's own empty span), and
  the line's `grid-auto-flow: column` gave every one of them a column: fifteen
  tracks for a three-column table, the cells at 51.6px. The cells are placed by
  index now and everything else is pinned into the first track at zero width,
  so a cell is a third of the row (257.9px of 794) whatever else a decoration
  leaves in the line. A spelling underline also used to be drawn outside the
  cell and split it into five (measured: 21 cells in one three-cell row); it
  nests inside now. Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/doctable.js`, 24 of 24
  in both themes.

- The board's zoom cluster is the same shape as the tool row it shares an
  edge with: one pill, one inset, instead of a rounded rectangle beside a
  pill (INBOX 43).
- A tidy writes the whole map in one request instead of one per node, and a
  tidy that pushed part of the map off the canvas frames it again.
- On a phone-width map, a branch can be folded again: the node's own action
  row had been sitting on top of its fold chevron, and the template offer on
  a new map covered the only topic that map had.
- A board or map exported into the image library arrives with a description
  naming the board it came from, so its card is no longer a picture over an
  empty strip on a notebook with no vision model (INBOX 184).
- A board or map exported into the image library arrives with a description
  naming the board it came from, so its card is no longer a picture over an
  empty strip on a notebook with no vision model (INBOX 184).
- Both of the mind map's radial rings sit on a ground of their own now, so a
  ring reads as one control rather than eight circles over the canvas
  (INBOX 191).
- The New board dialog opens on the kind of board you made last, and its
  button says Create rather than Save (INBOX 183).
- The map's top bar no longer runs off the right of the window. Layout and
  Tidy moved into the tool dock's own Layout section, the board picker keeps
  a name's worth of width on a narrow window, and the Library button drops
  its word before any menu drops theirs: 0 controls past the edge at 1440,
  1024 and 820 (INBOX 183).
- Shapes, lines and connectors no longer trail the note cards during a pan.
  The pan transform moved from the `<g>` inside each board SVG onto the
  `<svg>` root, because `will-change` on a `<g>` promotes nothing: measured
  through the layer tree, the SVG holding every shape was not a composited
  layer at all while a card was (INBOX 183).
- A middle-button pan on the board now says it is a pan while it runs: the
  grabbing cursor the hand tool uses, no text selection dragged out behind it,
  and the release no longer fires an `auxclick` (INBOX 183).
- Every image in a document's Live view drew "no longer in this notebook" over
  a file that was still there. The Live view's image widget set the raw
  `/media/…` path, and an `<img>` cannot send an unlock header, so the load
  answered 401 and the app's missing-media handler replaced it. It goes through
  `mediaSrc` now, like every other image in the app.

- The Timeline's automatic scale looks at the days you wrote on, not at how
  many things are in range. A week of writing with two hundred reminders due in
  it was being drawn in month buckets, so the whole week sat in one column: it
  keeps day buckets now, and a notebook spread over years still buckets by month.
  The count line under the dock says "items" rather than "notes", because the
  feed holds documents, boards and reminders too.

- Back and Close in Settings can be pressed on a 320px phone. The head of the
  sheet wrapped onto two lines there while keeping the height of one, so both
  controls were drawn over the search field below them and every tap reached
  the field instead.

- The Timeline's rows are called `rows`. The endpoint has called its list
  `notes` since before it held anything else, and it holds documents, boards
  and reminders now, so `notes[3]` could be a reminder. `notes` still carries
  the same list for one release, in case a cached copy of the app is older than
  the server it is talking to; it goes in the release after this one.

- On a phone the Timeline's kind filters are a finger's size and take a line of
  their own. Below 600 the four chips are their icons, which left them 33px
  wide against the 44px every other control in the app meets there, and the
  line they were meant to have was never given to them: their zone does not
  wrap, so at 320 they stacked four deep and the dock took 297px of an 844px
  screen. One row of 44px chips at 320, 360 and 390 now, and the dock is the
  same height at all three.

- A red test log no longer ends in a budget error that was never the fault. A
  skill run holds its token budget open across the generator that streams it,
  and a generator is closed by whoever happens to be running at the time, so a
  run abandoned mid-stream ended with `ValueError: Token was created in a
  different Context` from the budget's own cleanup, printed last and reading
  like the cause. The scope now ends cleanly wherever it is closed.

- The document editor's word menu follows its word, or closes. The menu copied
  the word's position when it opened and nothing re-measured it, so scrolling
  the editor under an open menu left it beside whatever had scrolled into that
  spot, 84px from the word it was about after an 80px scroll, and it stayed
  open after the word had left the editor entirely. It is re-measured on scroll
  and on resize now, and closes when the word is no longer visible: measured
  0px horizontally and 4px below the word after the scroll, closed after the
  word leaves the box.

- The graph's minimap has a size setting, Small or Large, beside its position
  in the graph's dock menu, and it fades out of the way while you are zoomed
  far enough out that the whole map is already on screen.

- Describing a picture with AI and reading text out of one now show up as
  background processes in the activity panel, so you can leave the dialog or
  the tab and still see what is running and how it ended.

- The ring of controls around a mind map topic now says what each one does. A
  caption under the ring names the slot you are pointing at or have moved to
  with the keyboard, and the two slots that Alt swaps for their opposite say
  so on the same line.

- Mind map branches are drawn as tapered ribbons, wide at the parent and
  narrowing towards the child, so a map reads as a tree growing outwards and
  each branch says which way it runs without an arrowhead. Lines you have set
  to straight, elbow or dashed keep the look you chose.

- A link tool on a mind map connects the map. Drawing a line from a topic to
  one that hangs off nothing now attaches it as a branch, with a real tree
  edge, instead of leaving a decorative curve over a node that is still not
  part of the map. Two topics that are both already in the tree still get a
  cross-link.

- Drag-select on a whiteboard or mind map works where the connectors are. Every
  link carries a wide invisible band so it can be clicked, and a rubber-band
  drag that began anywhere on that band did nothing at all, which on a board
  whose links cross the middle is most of the canvas. A connector no longer
  swallows the gesture, and clicking one still selects it.

- A picture card in the Library shows its selection tick when you are near it,
  not on every card all the time. The tick keeps the ground that makes it
  legible over a dark photograph, and stays visible on a card you have ticked,
  while a selection is running, and on a touch screen.

- A board or mind map preview no longer draws its labels over its own edge.
  Which side of a block the label hangs off was decided by the half of the
  board the block started in, so a wide topic just left of centre was labelled
  to its right and the name ran past the paper and was cut at the thumbnail's
  border. Both margins are measured now, the label takes the larger one and is
  cut to what that side can hold, and it is left off entirely where there is
  room for less than four characters.

- Boards and mind maps exported to the image library are described and read
  like any other picture. They were posted as staged uploads, which are
  processed only when a note or document later saves a reference to them, and
  nothing ever references a board export, so it arrived with no description
  and no text reading and the card had neither block on it.

- The document editor's word menu and word completion popup no longer open off
  the screen when the background art is on. Both are placed in the window's own
  coordinates, and both lived inside the document card, which carries a blur
  whenever the art is on; a blurred surface becomes the frame a fixed popup is
  laid out against, so the menu asked for `left 952, top 322` and drew at
  `1245..1485, 399`, 45px past the right edge of a 1440px window, 53px from the
  word it belonged to, and under the bars outside the card. Both popups now
  leave the card while they are open and go back on the way out, and the
  placement measures what was drawn and corrects itself, so any surface that
  gains a blur or a transform later cannot take them with it. Measured at 1440,
  1100 and 820 wide: 0px gap to the word, 0px past the card, nothing outside
  the window; the completion popup opened 294px from the caret before and 0px
  after.

- The writing caret in an answer stops blinking when you ask for less motion.
  It honoured neither the platform's reduce-motion setting nor the app's own
  "Progress indicators: Still", because the rule that stops it carried two of
  the caret's four selectors and both lost on specificity to the longer ones
  that place it after a paragraph, a list item or a quote. The caret itself
  stays either way, still 8px wide: an answer arriving with nothing on screen
  saying it is live is worse than a still caret.

- The bottom tab bar on a phone says which tab you are on. Below 480 all seven
  captions were hidden, so the bar was seven unlabelled glyphs with the selected
  one marked by colour alone; from 360 up the selected tab keeps its caption and
  the other six are icons, which is the shape the 820 to 1100 band already uses.
  Every column also has a 44px floor now: with "Chat" selected the selected
  column had been shrinking to 41.9px.

- A picture in the Library can be opened from the keyboard. The thumbnail and the
  filename both opened the picture on click, and neither was focusable: measured,
  the only controls a keyboard could reach on a resting card were the selection
  tick and Rename, so a keyboard could select a picture and rename it but could
  not open one, and a screen reader was read the file's alt text with nothing to
  say it did anything. The thumbnail is the control it already behaved like now:
  it takes focus, announces "Open <name>", answers Enter and Space, and draws a
  ring inside its own clipped frame.

- The document editor's phone targets. The sidebar sheet's rail toggle, the one
  control that opens the sidebar on a phone, was 36px square, and the Edit/Read
  segment 28px tall; both are 44px below 600px wide. The rail grows with the
  toggle rather than beside it, so the editor pays 8px of measure for it and
  nothing drifts. Rows inside the dock's own menus stay 36px on purpose: their
  target is the full width of the menu, and raising fifteen of them would make
  it 660px tall in an 820px window.

- The graph's minimap shows the graph's shape and where you are in it. It drew
  one dot per note and nothing else, measured at 172 dots and 0 edges on a
  172-note map: a cloud of points cannot say which part of the map is the dense
  cluster and which the chain, which is what an overview is for. The links are
  drawn under the dots now, at a hard cap and sampled evenly on a big notebook,
  and the note you have selected or have the keyboard on takes a ring, so the
  minimap answers "where is the note I am reading" as well as "what can I see".

- The document editor's AI assistant dialog. It opened as a 717px card whose
  largest element was an empty 309px box for the answer it had not been asked
  for yet, under a label for text that was not there and over a Replace button
  for nothing; it is 250px now, and the answer, its label and Replace arrive
  together when there is one. The Edit/Write/Remove toggle, the instruction
  field and the buttons are one height instead of five, the toggle's labels are
  the size of the field rather than larger than it, each verb carries its own
  icon, and the instruction and the button that acts on it share a row.
  Switching verb no longer leaves the previous verb's suggestion on screen
  under the new verb's accept button, which would have applied a rewrite as a
  removal.

- Board previews draw what is on the board. Every sketch on a board was drawn in
  the same corner at the same size, because a stroke is stored with x=0, y=0 and
  its path in board coordinates, so eight shapes previewed as one squiggle
  (measured: eight marks at one position and one size). The server reads each
  stroke's own box now, the way the canvas does, and sends the tool it was drawn
  with and its ink, so a rectangle previews as a rectangle, a circle as a circle,
  a line corner to corner and a pen stroke as a scribble in its own box. Blocks
  also stopped being blobs (a corner was 35% of a block's short side, now 8%), a
  picture on the board gets the picture glyph instead of a third shade of the
  same blue, and a card's title is drawn beside its block when it will not fit
  inside, so "Retry budget" reads as "Retry budget" rather than "Retr…".

- The writing suggestions panel is as tall as what is in it. A finding's
  candidates lie along its row rather than down the panel, and the panel no
  longer keeps a fixed floor it was always shrunk back to: one finding is 109px
  of panel around 97px of content, against 128px before with 29px of nothing in
  it, and the editor above it is up from 45% to 47% of the window. A row opened
  under Large text with Spacious on now fits inside the panel, which the old
  floor was 5px short of.

- A Files row's metadata starts to the right of its filename, not to the left of
  it. The name is a `figcaption` with an 8px inset of its own, while every block
  under it sat on the row's own margin, so the kind, size, reading controls and
  description all began 8px further left than the name they belong to. They
  share one edge 12.8px to its right now, measured at 1440, 820 and 390.

- The bar of actions for a selection stays with the selection. Tick something
  in the Library, the Notes list or the timeline table and the bar that appears
  now sticks to the top of the list it governs instead of scrolling away with
  it: measured before, the Notes bar sat at y=-465 with its list scrolled to
  the end, 677px of scroll putting every action for the selection out of reach.
  It is one component everywhere now rather than five near-copies, so the Notes
  and timeline bars wear the same accent strip as the Library's, and the bar
  under the Notes sub-tab strip stops below it rather than behind it.

- Six chat-surface reports. The user's bubble ran its words at 16px on a
  diagonal gradient with a 12px glow under a white label, beside an answer at
  14.72px; it is one flat accent surface, the answer's size, and a label in
  the body's own ink. Every bubble and the action row under it carried a soft
  8px shadow, three stacked in a band a few pixels tall; they lift by one
  pixel now. The Jump to latest pill's hover was a translucent tint over the
  transcript; it sits on an opaque ground. A bare URL the model writes shows
  as its site and page ("goodreads.com / … / the-page") with the full address
  as the tooltip, and a markdown link whose words are its own address gets the
  same. The dashboard's Continue pill ends in an ellipsis instead of stopping
  mid-word. The popup agent shows the writing caret while an answer streams,
  folds its tool calls under "Finished N steps" as the Chat tab does, and its
  "Opened" badges start at the left with an ellipsis instead of being cut at
  both ends.

- Exports are reachable again after the save. Every file the app saves
  (a graph image, a chat export, a download) now appears in the notifications
  with a click that opens the exports folder on the desktop or the new Recent
  exports list under Settings > Import & export in a browser tab, where each
  file has its own Download.
- The chat composer keeps the height it was dragged to. It forgot the drag
  whenever the box was empty, so a keystroke and a backspace snapped it back
  to one line; a dragged height now holds until the next drag, capped at 70%
  of the window.
- Two unused Phosphor build files (5 MB) left the repository.
- Notes with no tags are pointed out, and pointed at. A real note with no
  tags now carries a "No tags yet" chip where its tags would be, and clicking
  it opens the note for editing with the cursor in the tags field. The
  dashboard's Loose ends widget offers the filtered list beside its link
  finder, and past five untagged notes the bell says so once a week with the
  same list a click away.
- The Write with AI panel held its shape when a field was clicked. Focusing
  the instruction or tags field let the composer's own focus rule widen it to
  the column, pushing Undo and Draft it onto two more lines and the tags caret
  under its label; the rows are one line before and after focus now, and the
  draft's actions end at the column's right edge like the instruction row's.
- Dragging a card on a busy whiteboard cost a frame per pointer move. The
  alignment guides re-measured every other card on every move, forcing a
  layout each time; they measure once per drag now (7.67ms to 0.79ms per move
  on a large board).
- Middle-button panning on the whiteboard fought the browser's own
  autoscroll on Windows; the press is now the pan and nothing else.
- Settings > Packages rows keep their buttons beside the name. A long
  package name with its badges pushed Reinstall and Remove onto a second
  line (and one row onto three); the name wraps now and the buttons stay
  on its first line at every width.
- The graph's suggested-links rows have one control height: the reason
  field was 42px beside 28px buttons, so every row ran to 69px; it is 56px
  with the field at the buttons' height.
- The AI's question card chooses, then sends. An option marks itself, an
  "Or write your own answer" field sits under the options and one Send answer
  button submits; an answer typed in the chat bar folds the card away, so it
  can no longer send a second answer; a turn that ended by asking is not
  reported as having written nothing, and a reloaded thread shows what was
  asked instead of an empty bubble.
- `<br>` in an answer renders as a line break; the logs page's kebab button
  lost the fold chevron that was drawn over its dots; Shift with the arrow
  keys moves whiteboard items five grid cells (or 10px) at a time.
- Picture cards in the Library keep their thumbnails one size. Opening one
  card's text fold used to stretch every picture beside it to match the row;
  the pictures stay put and the row grows only by the fold's own bounded height.
- A table the AI writes can be taken away: Copy (for a spreadsheet),
  Markdown, CSV (saved like any export) and a Full view that lifts the table
  into a window-sized panel; code blocks gain Save beside Copy.
- The full view of a table opens above the app rather than behind its
  chrome, over a dimmed page, with its actions as one segmented control
  instead of four loose buttons; the header's icon buttons are grouped the
  same way, everyday toggles in one cluster and lock/quit in the other.
- Mind maps read better: the ring of controls around a selected topic has an
  opaque ground and an accent edge instead of grey-on-grey circles, branches
  draw at full strength with an arrowhead that takes the branch's colour, the
  text-size grip no longer sits under the node's own buttons, and the link
  tools can start and land on a topic.
- The round '?' buttons are circles again in the capture, Write with AI and
  Ask heads, a table's full view fits the panel with an "Actual size" toggle
  for the scrolling view, and every row of the boards dropdown says whether it
  is a board or a mind map.

- The lock screen could fail to appear on a slow first start. The embedding
  warm-up began importing torch the instant the server was up, and that import
  holds the interpreter for seconds on a small machine, long enough for the
  shell's status probe to time out and the app to say the server could not be
  reached. The warm-up now waits two seconds, so the first page and its probe
  go through first, and it skips an empty notebook altogether, which has
  nothing to warm a model for.
- "Uncaught ReferenceError: sizeDashWidgets is not defined" from the desktop
  window's log. The window resizes itself while the scripts are still loading,
  and the resize handler called into a file that had not arrived yet.

- The Library's picture cards, on the third report about them. The selection
  tick took the app's own surface colour, which over a photograph is a dark
  square on a dark thumbnail; it now has a near-white ground and a ring in both
  themes, because a picture is the same backdrop in both. The filename band was
  a gradient, so it vanished into a dark photograph and read as a grey strip
  across a light one; it is one flat ground of one height on every card (33.2px
  measured across nine). An open transcription could take a card to twice its
  neighbours' height and the grid gave the whole row that height; the fold
  scrolls at 11rem, so an open card measures 411px against a shut 241px.
- A picture's description could come back as a wall of the picture's own text.
  The caption prompt asked for the description "and any visible text worth
  naming", and a small vision model handed a screenshot answers the easier half
  by reading the words out. It now says not to transcribe, which is what the
  document prompt beside it already said.

- **The writing suggestions read as one feature, and the word menu stays next
  to its word.** Four surfaces (the underlines, the word menu, the panel at the
  foot, the dictionary) had grown separately: one finding was described in two
  orders, and acting on a row in the panel opened a 335px popup over the very
  sentence it was about, measured at 70% of a 1440x900 window spent on one
  misspelled word. A row now answers inside the panel (the same candidates and
  actions the menu offers, from one builder), the word it names is scrolled to
  the middle of the editor instead of just inside its bottom edge, the panel
  keeps its settled share when no row is open (14% of the window against the
  editor's 45%) and grows to 20% only while one is, and both the row and the
  menu's head draw the finding the same way: a dot in the colour of its
  underline, the words, the reason.

- **A flagged word that wraps no longer opens its menu somewhere else.** The
  menu was anchored to `getBoundingClientRect()`, which for a mark drawn as two
  fragments is the union of them: measured on a doubled "the the" at a wrap
  point, fragments at 1187..1218 and 471..497 and a union of 471..1218, so the
  menu opened 716px to the left of the words that were clicked, and a click
  anywhere in those 747px claimed the finding. Both questions are asked of
  `getClientRects()` now, so the menu opens against the fragment under the
  pointer. The menu is also clamped to the editor's own card rather than to the
  window (a word at the end of a long line had put 146px of it in the window's
  gutter, clear of the document), clamped on all four sides, and it scrolls a
  word it cannot see into view before pointing at it.

- The note edit form's formatting bar was see-through and hid behind the Notes
  sub-tab strip. Its background was a 4%-opaque tint meant to sit on a pane,
  which on a sticky strip left the note's own text showing through it, and it
  parked in the same band as the sub-tab strip, which is also sticky at the top
  of the same scroller and twenty layers above it. The tint now sits over an
  opaque base, and the bar stops below the strip: measured stuck at y=128 with
  the strip ending at 118, and nothing painted over it at any point down its
  height.

- Every note card claimed to be filed in "a space that no longer exists". The
  chip that names a note's workspace fell back to that wording whenever the
  space list had not arrived yet, and the note list renders before it does, so
  a notebook whose notes are all in the Default Space said the opposite on
  every card. It says nothing until the list lands, and the list re-renders
  when it does.

### Changed

- The graph's gravity slider moves the centring pull and the spacing between
  nodes along with the repulsion, so maximum gravity is tight rather than
  merely less loose (unchanged at the default), and a new View option,
  Length by similarity, on by default, draws a strongly related pair closer
  than a weak one (INBOX 243).
- The graph's look, kept flat to match the rest of the app: each node is
  its category colour with a ring in the card colour so it reads clear of
  the links, every node carries a soft glow (wider on hubs; the earlier
  highlight dot is gone), the halo ring and the accent ring on hubs are
  gone, links are thinner and fainter, and a faint wash of each cluster's
  colour sits behind it so the shape of the notebook reads before a single
  label does. Nodes are drawn from cached sprites, so a large map costs no
  more than before. Two new View options: Curved links and Cluster glow.
- **The graph's touch gestures and its world constant are measured, not
  assumed.** `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphtouch.js` drives a real touch context:
  a 96x48 one-finger drag moves the camera 107.3px and a pinch from 80px to
  280px between the fingers scales the map 3.5x, at 390 and at 1440, with the
  page not scrolling sideways at either. `gcWorldFor`'s comment claimed the
  1.6-to-1.25 change was neutral at 35 and 300 notes; it is neutral at 35 at
  both widths, and at 300 only on a desktop, where the viewport floor is 2531
  against a phone's 1168. The comment now says which.

- **Turning "Mind maps" off on the graph now takes them off the map.** The
  switch is called Boards, it covers whiteboards as well, and off means the
  board is not a node at all rather than a node that stops saying it is one:
  measured, five boards drawn as ordinary notes with the switch off before,
  none after, four typed `map` with it on.

- **The canvas graph's forty module globals are one surface object.** The
  renderer kept its node array, camera, worker, hover and selection in
  module-level `let`s, which is exactly right for one canvas and impossible
  for two. Every drawing function now takes the surface it is working on
  (`s = gcTab` by default, so every existing caller and sweep reads as it
  did), and `size: "full" | "pane"` says whether it owns the Graph tab's
  chrome. Behaviour-neutral: `graph.js`, `graph4.js`, `graph4b.js`,
  `graphhover.js`, `graphminimap.js` and `graphcold.js` measured before and
  after on one fixture, same node counts, camera, canvas size, hover and
  minimap.

- **The Timeline is a feed.** It was two views and a popup: a grid of one
  column per bucket (8,800px wide against a 1,358px viewport, 79% of its cells
  empty) and an SVG line chart with 14 text nodes for 48 notes, no titles and
  no keyboard stops. It is now one vertical feed, newest first, with a sticky
  header per day, week, month or year, a row per note carrying its title,
  snippet, category, tags and time, and a note that opens where it sits
  instead of in a hand-placed popup. Rows are reachable by keyboard (arrows
  move, Enter opens), the find box filters the rows rather than dimming them,
  the bucket picker gained an "Auto" default that follows how much is in
  range, and changing the bucket costs no request. Measured at 1440, 1024 and
  390: 0 horizontal scroll (was 7,663px), 48 of 48 rows with a readable title
  (was 0), sticky headers pinned at 0px from the top of the feed.

- **The Timeline is no longer capped at 1,500 notes, and has a density strip.**
  It drew up to 1,500 rows and simply stopped, with nothing on screen to say
  the rest of the notebook was missing. It pages now: 300 rows at a time,
  fetched as you reach the end of the last page, so a notebook of any size
  scrolls through. Beside the feed is a strip showing how much you wrote across
  the whole range, with a marker for where you are; click or drag it to jump.
  It appears once a range holds 200 notes, below which it is a row of identical
  marks. Measured on a 2,048-note notebook over three years: no frame longer
  than 50ms while paging, and no horizontal scrollbar at any point.

- **The Timeline has a table view.** The same notes with every column at once:
  date, title, kind, category, space, tags, words and links, each sortable from
  its own column label, with a sticky head and two columns on a phone. Ticking
  rows drives the Notes list's own Move, Tag and Delete, over the same
  selection and with the same undo. `/timeline` now returns a note's space,
  word count and link count for those columns. Switching between the feed and
  the table is a repaint: it reloads nothing.

### Added

- The README's tour is thirteen screenshots of the current interface, up from
  eight of an older one. Five surfaces it never showed are in it now: a
  whiteboard board, a concept map, the Tools and features browser, the command
  palette and the Appearance panel. `tests/test_readme_freshness.py` fails on a
  README image with no file behind it, and on a capture the README shows
  nowhere.

- Both catalogues know about the app as it is now. "Tools and features" had 48
  rows and the command palette 44, and between them they never mentioned
  documents, boards, concept maps, the Library's sub-tabs, the timeline, the
  page reader's neighbours, resurfacing, the spelling dictionary, workspaces or
  seven of the settings sections. The browser now lists 110 rows in nine
  groups and the palette 57 commands, and `tests/test_feature_catalog.py`
  fails the build when a row names a tab, a section, an element id or a
  function that does not exist.

- The chat composer's attach picker shows the picture. Its Images tab was five
  checkboxes beside five generated filenames, which is not a list you can
  choose from: reported as "images just show as their names but the user might
  not be able to tell what those images are from their names". Every image row
  now carries a thumbnail and the image's caption, or, for a picture with no
  caption, the note it is used in. The "captioned" badge is gone, the caption
  it announced is on the row instead.

- The page reader has a way in that does not start from a file. It was
  reachable only from a file you had already found (a Files row, an image
  card's menu, or the lightbox), so "I want to read something" had no answer.
  It is in the command palette and in Tools & features now, and opens on what
  you were last reading, else your newest PDF or picture, else the Files
  sub-tab with a line saying there is nothing to read yet.

- Documents: a paragraph can be linked to. "Link to this block" in the "/"
  menu gives the paragraph the caret is in a short id and copies
  `[[Document title#^the-id]]`, which resolves from a note, a map node, a chat
  or another document and opens the document at that paragraph rather than at
  the top. `![[Document title#^the-id]]` embeds the paragraph itself, quoted,
  with a line saying where it came from, in both the writing pane and the
  reading one. The id is scaffolding, so it is hidden while you write (and
  comes back when the caret is on its line) and never appears in the reading
  pane or the printed PDF.

- Boards and board images come back a page at a time. Both lists grew with
  the notebook and handed back all of it in one response, and a board row
  carries a preview, so the response grew with every board anyone drew. Each
  takes a page size and an offset now and says how many there are in total,
  and every surface that needs the whole list (the boards gallery, the board
  picker, the command palette, the dashboard widget) reads to the end. Building
  a board's preview is a query per board, and that now happens for the page
  rather than for every board in the notebook.

- Five invisible animations stopped running. The app builds six copies of its
  generated emblem at startup and five of them sit inside a panel you are not
  looking at, each redrawing 24 times a second for a canvas with no size on
  screen: measured on an idle board, six canvases alive, one visible, and five
  animation frames asked for per frame drawn. Each one now pauses while it is
  off screen and turns again the moment it is shown, so the mark is never
  static where you can see it and never drawn where you cannot.

- Mind map: a radial map no longer overlaps itself once it is bigger than one
  turn of the circle. Thirty nodes in the radial layout put six pairs of
  topics on top of each other, the worst by 38 by 28 board units, because the
  layout normalised the whole map onto one turn however much room its nodes
  needed. The rings widen instead, so every node keeps the arc it occupies;
  small maps are laid out exactly as before. Root placement on open and the
  edges that follow a drag are measured now as well: no overlap with the top
  bar, and edge ends that stay on their two nodes through a leaf drag, a whole
  branch drag and a multi-selected drag.

- Whiteboard: export is a dialog, the selection handles are one recipe, and
  the highlighter behaves like one. Export was a list of every scope and
  format pair that ran off the bottom of the window; it is two rows of
  segments and one Export button now. A note, a shape, an image and a text box
  all show the same eight handles, the same rotate grip on a stem and the same
  1px selection box, where a drawn shape used to show a dashed outline of
  itself and no box at all. The highlighter multiplies, so two crossing
  strokes read as two passes of one pen, and its nib is a nib (12 to 24px)
  rather than four times whatever the pen slider said; Shift draws a straight
  run.

- Whiteboard: one context bar where the floating selection pill and the
  properties drawer used to be two. It appears above whatever is selected and
  shows only that kind's controls, so a line offers its ends and a text box
  does not, and the caps it shows are read from the object rather than from
  the tool's own default. The long tail (copy style, the box's background,
  guide colours, extract notes, export) is behind one "..." menu, and the
  drawer that used to hold 13.5rem of every board open, and more than half of
  a phone, is gone.

- Documents: tables you edit rather than type. `/table`, Tab between cells,
  a cell menu for rows, columns and alignment, and the table drawn as a real
  grid in Live. The markdown underneath is the markdown you wrote, to the
  byte: every command edits the smallest span it can, so a hand-aligned table
  keeps its alignment and a cell holding an escaped pipe keeps its pipe.
- Documents: callouts written `> [!note]-` fold away and open again on their
  own label, footnotes render as the raised number they are and go to their
  text when clicked, `$x^2$` renders as math through a MathML renderer in the
  app itself rather than a library, and each heading in the outline carries
  how many of its section's tasks are done.
- Documents: `![[a note]]`, `![[a map]]` and `![[a file]]` draw the thing
  inline, through the same note card, map preview and file tile the rest of
  the app already uses.

- Whiteboard: the arrange tools answer all three of their questions. Space
  evenly now leaves equal gaps rather than equal centres, which is the same
  thing only when every item is the same size and is not what a row of mixed
  cards needs; and "same width" and "same height" exist at all, giving every
  selected item the largest one's size while it keeps its own corner.

- The whiteboard's tool rail says which key holds each tool, and shows the
  ink it will draw with. Every tool now names its key in its tooltip (the
  sticky note is N, the two connectors are C and Shift+C, the image is I),
  each of those keys picks that tool, and a swatch at the end of the rail
  shows the pen's colour and opens the picker without having to open the
  properties drawer to find out what colour is loaded. The board overview
  moved from N to Shift+N, which is the letter it had taken from the sticky.

- Three notes a day that are slipping out of reach. A note you wrote months
  ago, linked to nothing and never opened since, is the one thing a notebook
  can give you that a pile of files cannot, and until now nothing in the app
  ever brought one back. The score is computed from three facts you can
  check (its age, its links, how often you have opened it) rather than a
  model's opinion, the day's three are the same all day and different
  tomorrow, a notebook under ten notes gets nothing rather than the same
  three for ever, and "never again" is permanent.

- A link suggestion you dismiss stays dismissed, and a search remembers
  which result you opened. The dismissal used to live in the browser and die
  with the tab, so the same pair came back; and asking a question a second
  time returned the same order, including the order that was wrong enough
  that you scrolled past the first result. Both are reorders of what the
  search already found, never additions, so one click can never change what
  the notebook appears to contain.

- The notebook keeps what it has been corrected about, in one place. Moving
  a note out of the category the AI chose, dismissing a suggested link,
  opening a result after a question, or sending a resurfacing card away are
  all recorded as corrections, and what a pile of the same correction adds
  up to is a bounded weight that halves every thirty days, so a rule you
  stop reasserting fades rather than becoming permanent.

- Save a copy of a file from the Library. The Files rows' menu now hands you
  the original file back, which nothing in the Library could do before.

- A skill step that has to go through every note now goes through every note.
  A step that reads a page at a time keeps reading until there are no pages
  left, instead of stopping after the first one and ticking itself off. The
  run says which page it is on and how many notes it has read as it goes, and
  if there is more than one step can reach, it says that too rather than
  reporting part of your notebook as all of it.

- A skill run now has a budget: how many tokens and how many seconds it may
  spend, in Settings -> Tools, 20,000 and 90 seconds to begin with. A run that
  reaches it stops between steps, says which limit it hit, and still shows
  what it changed with a way to put it back. Set either to 0 for no limit.

- A skill can say how to check its own work. When it finishes, the app reads
  the answer back out of your notebook itself and shows a line saying whether
  it holds, rather than taking the AI's word for it. "Find loose ends" uses
  it to prove it changed nothing.

- The AI learns where you actually file things. When you move a note the AI
  filed by itself, that move is remembered, and the next few times it decides
  where something belongs in that category it is shown what you corrected.

- A board keeps a history too. Moving a card, rewriting a text box, deleting
  a branch, creating, duplicating, generating or importing a board: each one
  is recorded with who did it and what it looked like before, so a board's
  parts can be rebuilt from their own history the way a note already could.

- A board the AI builds is recorded the same way as one you build by hand.
  Cards it places, links it draws, maps it creates and the nodes it adds all
  keep what they looked like, so a whole board the AI made can be rebuilt
  from its own history. Before this the log said a card had been placed and
  could not say where.

- One search across the whole notebook. Notes, boards, documents, the text
  read out of files, bookmarks and reminders are in one index, so a word you
  wrote in a document is found by the same search that finds it in a note.

- Every result says why it is a result: matched your words, matched the
  title, matched a tag, similar meaning, or linked to the note you have
  open. The Notes list shows it as a line under the note, with the three
  scores behind the tooltip.

- Search operators everywhere they are typed: `tag:`, `kind:`, `in:` (or
  `space:`), `before:` and `after:`, `has:`, `is:`, `"quoted phrases"` and
  `-excluded`. They need no AI and no model running.

- `GET /search` and `GET /search/stats` for anything that wants the same
  answers the app's own search box gets.

### Changed

- The Library's saved links are list rows rather than a table of raw addresses.
  Asked for directly: "is there a wya to redesign the links cards/rows in the
  links library subtab to make them look nicer and more modern??" Measured at
  1440 on eight seeded links: every row drew its own permanent outline, rows
  came in two heights (67.2px, or 89.2px once a link had a group), and each
  held six controls and five type sizes, with an underlined blue title over the
  whole address. Now one row height at every width, on the app's own list-row
  tokens: a mark, the title, and one line of facts (the site, the group, the
  note) in the same shape a Files row uses, with the ground arriving under the
  pointer instead of an edge drawn around every row. Two controls on a row at
  rest, pin and the '...' menu, where Edit, Move to group, Delete and a new
  Copy link live.

- The bottom of a Library picture card is two ranks instead of four. Reported a
  third time: "redesign the bottom text area of the image cards in the library
  images subtab again", with the block reading as four unrelated rows of
  different weights and the cards looking uneven. Measured at 1440: three rows
  under the picture at three type sizes two pixels apart (13.6 / 12 / 11.2),
  and a foot that ran 9.6px to 115.5px across one row of six cards. The count
  and the "text in this image" fold share one line of facts now, the way a
  Files row already puts its own facts on one; the description and the picture's
  name share one size and the facts line is the only other one; and the
  description holds its second line open, so every card that has anything to
  say is the same height inside and its photograph is the same size. Six cards
  at 1440: feet 54.1/95.7/95.7/10.6 by what the card holds, against six
  different feet before, pictures 144px on every card with a caption and a
  fact, 0px of dead space under any card, and contrast 7.48 / 7.53 / 6.56 in
  light and 6.47 / 6.44 / 5.06 in dark.

- Settings → Logs has the same head as every other surface in the app. It was
  two rows of nine controls at four heights (a view segment, two pickers, a
  filter box, a Follow switch, a live pill and three verbs), none of it on the
  dock grammar the tab heads use: reported as "redesign the top dock at the top
  of the settings logs page to be more consistent with the rest of the
  application and modern". One row now, at one height, at every width: the
  title and the live pill, the filter, list or terminal as two icons, and
  Support bundle as the one filled action, with Follow, Copy all, Clear and the
  two pickers in the '...' menu beside it. Three fixes came out of it that were
  not about this screen: an enhanced select in any dock had no width floor (the
  floor had been sizing the hidden native element behind it), a view segment
  folded into a dock menu at narrow widths drew its cells 108px tall instead of
  28px, and the Support bundle button dropped its own icon the first time
  anybody built a bundle.

- The meeting recorder holds its controls the way the rest of the app does.
  Three sentences of explanation stood between the title and the one button the
  dialog is for, and are now one line with the rest behind the app's own '?'.
  The Record button, the clock and the wave that moves while you talk were
  three loose siblings of the card, so the clock read as a stray number and the
  wave pushed the transcript 5rem down the moment recording started: they are
  one panel now, on the same inner corner the sketch pad's bars take. The four
  buttons under the transcript were 40px and 42px in the same row, and Discard
  sat one slip away from Save; they are one height now, with Discard at the far
  end.

- The popup agent looks like the rest of the app. The Ctrl+Shift+A surface had
  no title and no visible way out (Escape and a click on the backdrop both
  worked, and neither is something you can see), its four example prompts wrapped
  three-then-one, its content was inset 8px further left than every other dialog
  in the app, and its two internal hairlines were drawn in two different weights.
  It now opens with the same head every panel here has, the examples sit in two
  columns that are the same shape at every width, and the insets and the rules
  are the card's own.

- The quick sketch pad's controls are grouped and named. The toolbar was one
  pill holding four runs of unequal density: twelve controls at five heights
  across five rows at 1440 and at 1024, with the pen, highlighter and eraser
  wrapping to a second line inside their own box and the paper colour pushed
  under the undo run. It is six labelled sections now, Draw, Shapes, Ink,
  Size, Edit and Paper, separated by the app's own hairline, one row at both
  widths, every button on the control height, and the width slider has a name
  and shows the number it is set to. The bar under the canvas is the toolbar's
  surface upside down, so the toolbar, the canvas and the caption row share
  one inset and one corner instead of three. Reported once more after that
  first pass and fixed with it: the bar wrapped on any machine set to Large
  text or Spacious density, because the card is capped in pixels while
  everything in it is sized in rem. The controls sit on the app's hit-target
  size now, undo, redo, clear, the picture and the paper colour are one Canvas
  group rather than two, and the groups share out whatever width is left, so
  the bar is one row at 1440 and 1024 on every combination of those settings
  and has nothing empty at either end.

- Your documents, reminders and pictures arrive a page at a time. All three
  lists used to hand back every row on every call: 300 documents measured
  116.7 KB in one response, 300 reminders 52.5 KB, 300 pictures 117.6 KB,
  with nothing to stop them growing with the table. Each list now sends at
  most two hundred rows and says how many there really are, and the screens
  that need all of them (the Documents tab, the Library's documents and
  images, the editor's insert menus) ask for the next page until they have
  everything. Nothing you could reach before is out of reach: what is bounded
  is the size of one answer, not the size of your notebook.

- The bottom of a picture card in the Library is a caption again, not a form.
  A card carries its description, clamped to two lines so a long one cannot
  push the cards beside it out of line, and under it only what that picture
  actually has: how many places use it, and a fold for the text found in it
  where there is any. Where the picture is used, opening it full size, copying
  the markdown that puts it in a note, and every note, document and board it
  appears in are rows of the card's menu. A card in a row of six stood 321.1px
  whatever it held, with 54.5px of nothing under the emptiest one; it is
  261.5px now, the bottoms line up, and the slack goes to the photograph.

- The Documents sidebar was redesigned, both of its tabs. The outline now
  takes the height the column has instead of a fixed 224px window that hid 13
  of a 21-heading document's entries, it marks the heading you are reading as
  you scroll and keeps that row in view, and its levels are told apart by
  weight, colour and a guide line rather than by a fraction of a millimetre of
  type. An empty References no longer reserves a heading and a full-width
  button over nothing. In the Documents tab every row draws the same shape
  rather than only the open one, every row is one height, and each says what
  kind of file it is.

- The history of a note no longer keeps a copy of its whole text for ever.
  Changes older than ninety days keep the record of what happened and who
  did it, and let go of the text, apart from the five most recent changes to
  anything, which are always kept. On a notebook of 150 notes edited 40
  times each this took the history from 9.9 MB to 1.5 MB, and the file
  itself from 13.5 MB to 3.0 MB. Putting a note back the way it was still
  works for everything inside the window, and a change whose text is no
  longer kept says so rather than looking empty.

- Opening a note's history is no longer slower the more the notebook has
  been used: it is served from an index rather than by reading the whole
  log. Measured on 60,000 recorded changes, 6.390 ms became 0.082 ms.

- Opening the history of a much edited note is faster again: each page is
  built from its own page rather than from the whole of that note's log.
  Measured on a note with 4,000 recorded changes, the first page went from
  109 ms to 36 ms and an older page from 104 ms to 3 ms.

- The activity feed no longer reports a summarised change as having rewritten
  every field at once. A change whose text has been let go says so, and the
  summary standing in for a run of old changes says how many it covers.

- Finding notes similar to the one you are reading no longer reads every
  stored vector for every note opened. They are held in one array, built
  once when the embedding model finishes loading and kept up to date by
  each save: measured on 5,000 notes on the development sandbox, 18ms a
  call became under a millisecond.

- Every change to a note is recorded as one event, with who made it and the
  whole value of each field it set: a person, a named AI tool, or a named
  background job. A note's History sheet lists them, any point in it can be
  restored, and restoring is itself undoable.

- A note's history can be replayed: the note is rebuilt from its own events
  rather than from a copy, so what the sheet offers to restore is what the
  note actually was at that moment.

- `GET /events?since=` reads the log forwards from a cursor, for anything
  that needs to follow what happens in the notebook.

- Emptying the recycle bin, or deleting several notes for good, records one
  event carrying the list of ids rather than one per note.

- A mind map has its own controls now, not the whiteboard's. Selecting a
  topic puts a strip above it with bold, italic, four text sizes, alignment,
  colour and a link, in the place the board's own selection bar would take;
  right-clicking a topic opens a ring of eight branch actions around it (add
  a branch, add one beside it, fold, lay the branch out again, copy it, label
  the line into it, cut it free, back to the branch), with Alt turning the
  two add slots into the two remove slots; and right-clicking a line opens
  the same ring on the line (turn it around, label it, curve, elbow,
  straight, dash, colour, cut).

- A topic can carry an icon and point at a page, a line can say what it
  means, and both are stored with the map.

- The middle of every line has a `+` that puts a topic between the two it
  joins, and a topic's own corner drags its text size between 10 and 44px.

- Dragging a topic takes its branch with it, and dropping it on another topic
  moves the branch there, with the topic you are aiming at outlined. Ctrl
  held moves the topic alone and lets its children up to its old parent.

- A folded branch's count is a button: clicking the number opens the branch
  again, and the map menu has "Open every folded branch".

- `C` folds and unfolds the selected branch on a map. Space stays the
  canvas pan, and works on a fold control itself when that has the focus.

- A topic can be drawn as a rounded card, a pill, a box, or as plain text on
  the line with no card at all, from the strip above it. The shape is kept in
  the map's exports.

- Exporting a map keeps how it looks. Weight, slant, text size, alignment,
  icon, link, colour, and a line's label, shape and dash are written into the
  FreeMind `.mm` and OPML files and read back when one is imported, each in
  the place that format really has for it. A Markdown outline is still plain
  text on purpose.

- The dashboard's Rediscover widget now shows the three notes slipping out
  of reach rather than a random one: oldest, least linked, least opened, with
  the reason on each card ("120 days old, no links, never opened") and a
  "Never again" the notebook remembers. Under ten notes it still shuffles,
  because the three most faded out of five notes are the same three for ever.
  Notes has a matching "Forgotten first" sort.

### Fixed

- The Ask sub-tab's answer head no longer wraps. The "AI answer" label, the
  model badge and the Retry / Copy / read-aloud buttons were four items
  competing for one width with no rule about which of them gives way: measured
  at 1440, 1024 and 820 the actions always sat a line below the label, and with
  a real long model id the head grew to 91.6px around a 21.2px line of text. It
  is one 36px row at all three widths now, whatever answered the question: the
  badge is the only zone that shrinks, it carries the model id alone with
  "answered by ..." on its tooltip, and the three actions became an all-icon
  group on the app's own control height.

- Opening the page reader from a PDF in the lightbox closes the lightbox. The
  reader opened underneath it (`.lightbox` is z-index 1020, the reader is a
  modal at 1010), so every click landed on the lightbox's dismiss backdrop and
  the reader could not be reached until the lightbox was closed by hand.

- Searching for a percent sign found every note in the notebook. `%` and `_`
  are wildcards in the query the search builds, and nothing in the search box
  said so, so `100%` matched every row and `a_b` matched `axb`. Thirteen
  searches across notes, documents, chats, tags and wiki links now escape
  what you typed, and the test greps every one of them so a new search cannot
  quietly reintroduce it.

- On a phone, the whole application slid 7px sideways under your finger, on
  every tab: the header asked for 410px of a 390px screen. It fits now, and
  on a 360 or a 320 the decorative mark steps aside for the controls. The
  dashboard's "Edit layout" button, which had been half off the right edge
  and only reachable because of that slide, takes a row of its own.

- Touch targets below 44px in thirteen places nobody had measured: both
  sub-tab strips, the dashboard's quick links and stat tiles, and nine of the
  settings sheet's twenty controls. The sweep that checks this covered three
  surfaces out of sixteen and now covers all of them.

- The changelog was the one part of the app that answered a request from
  somebody who had not unlocked the notebook. Every route is now walked by a
  test that asks each one, without a token, whether it says no.

- An update whose download link pointed anywhere but this app's own releases
  is refused before anything is downloaded. The installer is downloaded and
  run silently, so where it comes from is worth checking.

- A note now has the same length limit a document has. The same paste was
  accepted in one box and refused in the other, and the accepted one took
  over two seconds. A tag is trimmed to a label's length instead of being
  stored at whatever length it arrived, and a note is never lost because one
  of its tags was too long.

- A saved link attached to a note or a document can be deleted again.
  Attaching it was what made it permanent: the delete failed and left it in
  the list.

- A note with a saved link, a recognised person or a resurfacing score on
  it can be deleted for good again. Emptying the bin, or destroying one such
  note, failed outright and left it where it was.

- A document with a note attached to it can be deleted again. It could not
  be deleted at all: the delete failed on a database constraint and left the
  document in place, so the feature that joins notes and documents together
  was what made a document permanent.

- Saving two notes at the same moment can no longer lose one. If both
  needed a category that did not exist yet, one of them failed outright on
  a database constraint. Measured with six writers saving twelve notes each:
  5 of 72 saves died before, none after. The app really does have several
  writers, since the desktop window, a browser tab and the overnight filing
  all save notes.

- Nine lists that stopped at the first page now read to the end: the
  Reminders tab and its dashboard widgets, the command palette's reminder
  search, both "file this note under a document" pickers, the note picker's
  document, file and image sources, and the lookup that resolves a pasted
  image back to its library row. Reminders are ordered soonest first, so a
  first page of old ticked-off ones could have hidden everything upcoming.

- Asking the AI about your reminders no longer hands it every reminder you
  have. Everything a tool returns is spent from the model's context window,
  so a long list left no room to reason about it; it now returns a page and
  says how many there are in total.

- On a phone, the Documents editor's "Ask AI" button was entirely off the
  side of the screen and the whole column scrolled sideways. A rule meant
  for card heads told the dock's action row never to shrink, so it
  overflowed instead of wrapping.

- The line numbers go away with the box they number. Turning on line numbers
  and then pressing Preview, in the capture box or in a note's edit form, left
  the numbers column behind as a small tinted box floating above the rendered
  panel, because the column is the writing box's neighbour rather than part of
  it and nothing hid the pair together.

- A dropdown that opens above its button no longer floats away from it. A menu
  taller than the room under its opener was measured at the height it wanted,
  placed by that height, and then drawn shorter by the stylesheet's own limit,
  so the gap between the two was the difference: on a notebook with nine
  categories, the capture form's "File under" list opened 127px above the
  button it belongs to. It now shows all of itself, ending 4px above its
  opener.

- The Ask tab's two rows of suggestions stop repeating each other. "Try
  asking" is generated from your own categories and "Ask again" is what you
  have actually asked, and neither knew about the other, so a suggestion you
  clicked once appeared in both rows from then on. What you have asked wins,
  and the generated row fills the gap with its next suggestion.

- Write with AI is two of the same column. The two writing boxes were
  different heights for no reason, the left column ended with an empty strip
  under it while the draft beside it ran on, the revision instruction sat
  between two buttons that do not read it, and the row under the draft mixed
  a text field into a line of three buttons of three different weights. Both
  columns are now a label, a box, one optional field and one line of actions,
  and the boxes are the same size and end on the same line.

- Every control on the Capture form is one of two heights, and the Ask card's
  blocks sit on one step rather than four.

- A generated or imported mind map replays with its nodes on it. Both
  routes recorded one event for the whole board whose payload held a node
  count rather than the nodes, so rebuilding one from its history gave an
  empty board while every hand-placed object rebuilt correctly.

- Five database indexes that were missing, including both columns of the
  link table. A note's connections, the notes list's bulk link fetch, the
  graph build and search's two-hop walk all read `entry_links` by source or
  target, and neither column was indexed, so each read walked the whole
  table; a board's objects were read the same way. Every list query the app
  issues is now served by an index, with no whole-table sort left.

- A mind map's ring of controls no longer covers the topic it belongs to. It
  was a circle drawn around the topic's centre, so on any topic wider than the
  ring was round two of its eight buttons sat on the topic's own words: the
  ring is now pushed clear of the topic's box, the edit strip above it stands
  off the ring rather than the topic, and the topic's two hover buttons, which
  the ring already offers, stand down while it is open.

- The whiteboard and mind map View menu uses the whole window again. It was
  measured with the stylesheet's own height limit still applied, so it was
  placed lower than it needed to be and then cut to the room left under that
  line: on a 760px-tall window it now shows all of itself where it used to
  scroll, and on shorter windows it shows about 48px more of itself.

- The "new from a template" dialog reads as a list of choices rather than six
  outlined boxes, and its Cancel sits at the right with every other dialog's
  actions. Ten dialogs had been asking for that alignment in their markup
  against a rule that did not exist.

- The note composer's formatting strip, and the one in a note's edit form, are
  the composer's own tighter strip again in both toolbar layouts. The single
  row layout was handing them the document editor's full-page padding, and the
  edit form's strip, which is meant to wrap rather than scroll, was drawing a
  third of its buttons outside its own box.

- The agent activity panel fits its runs. A run's "Step 2 of 3" was breaking
  across two lines beside its progress bar, which made every row a third
  taller and pushed a third run out of sight; the panel also honours "reduce
  motion" now.

- The notes list reads the attachments table once per page instead of once
  per note. Counted on a 60-note page: 67 database statements, 60 of them
  the same attachments query, and 8 after. It is the most-requested
  endpoint in the app.

- The launcher's progress now finishes. Five steps were reported and only
  four were ever ticked, because the last one belongs to the app's own
  window and nothing was marking it done, so the bar stopped short of the
  end of its track every launch and then the app appeared.

- The cursor on a whiteboard or a mind map follows the tool you are holding.
  Hovering a topic with the delete tool showed the open hand that means
  "drag this", which promised the opposite of what the click would do; every
  tool that acts on a point now keeps its own cursor over the things on the
  board. The fill, sticky note and text box tools had no cursor of their own
  at all and showed the hand over the empty canvas too.

- The board picker in the whiteboard's top bar now says which of your boards
  are mind maps and which are whiteboards, the way the board cards already
  do. Before, both kinds read as "Name (N items)" with nothing to tell them
  apart.

- A file row in the Library is a third shorter and says what matters first:
  the name, then one line carrying what the file is, whether it has been
  read and where it is used, then its description. It was five stacked
  blocks each holding one short phrase.

- The tree, radial and arc graph views no longer come out as a scatter of
  crossing links. Switching to one of them while the force layout was still
  settling let a position update from the old layout land after the new one
  had been drawn, overwriting most of it; switching at a quieter moment was
  fine, which is why it came and went.

- Clicking a note on the graph opens its panel in every view, not only the
  force one. The other three views have no drag (their shape is the meaning,
  so a note cannot be pulled out of it), and the click had been riding on the
  drag.

- Trace, started from a note's panel on the graph, finds the note. It always
  answered "that note isn't on the map right now" with the note plainly on the
  map. Picking two notes by clicking them on the map was never affected.

- Panning and zooming the graph does less work per pointer event: the minimap
  moves its viewport rectangle instead of redrawing every dot, and it does it
  once per frame rather than once per event. Measured over a forty-move pan,
  202 document lookups and 40 full minimap repaints before, 0 and 0 after.

- The "related elsewhere" panel a chat answer shows when no note answered
  costs three database scans instead of eighteen. It ran three queries per
  word of the question, each an unindexable `ILIKE '%word%'` over the two
  widest text columns in the schema; measured on 2,000 documents, 2,000
  saved chats and 2,000 reminders, 145.3 ms before and 118.8 ms after, and
  109.8 to 85.3 ms for a question that matches nothing.

- The collapsed sidebar rail's expand button is centred in the rail. It was
  6px from the inside of the left border and 4px from the right, because
  the centring arithmetic halved the rail's 48px column while the button is
  laid out in the rail's 46px padding box; two zero insets and auto margins
  replace the number. Every "?" in Settings now stands at the end of its
  heading row, in one column with the marks on the switch rows, instead of
  hugging headings of four different lengths at four different positions.

- The spell checker knows English again on a Windows checkout. Every one of
  the 92,972 dictionary entries was arriving with a trailing carriage return,
  so none of them matched and an ordinary document came back with a
  suggestion for nearly every word in it. The loader trims each entry, and
  `.gitattributes` now pins line endings so the checkout cannot do it again.

- Tonal buttons no longer wear a panel's shadow. In dark mode every one of
  them painted `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35)`, because that shadow token is seven
  times heavier in dark (it has to be, over a near-black page) and was sized
  for a panel rather than a 28px control, so a toolbar came out as a row of
  dark rims. The hairline edge stays, which is what makes a tonal button read
  as pressable.

- The history sheet no longer shows a note's newest fifty changes as though
  they were all of them. It says how many it is showing and offers to load
  the older ones.

- Deleting a card no longer fails on a board that holds a drawing saved in
  an older shape.

- A ring of actions opened on a topic near the edge of the window no longer
  loses the slots that fall past the edge, or puts them under the top bar.
  The whole ring slides back inside the canvas and keeps its shape.

- The strip above a selected topic no longer stands out of the window on a
  phone: it wraps to two rows when the canvas is narrower than it is.

- A right-click on a mind map topic, or on an idle text box, opened nothing
  at all. The guard that protects a text box's own native menu while you are
  typing in it matched every box that was *not* being typed in as well.

- A trunk can carry its own colour. The picker refused it on the grounds that
  a colour paints the line into a node and a trunk has none, which is true of
  the line and false of the card the colour was already painting.

- Clicking a control on a mind map topic no longer saves the topic
  underneath it. A click is a drag that never moved, and the board saved the
  object on every one of them: a click on a fold chevron sent two conflicting
  writes to the same row in one go, so a branch folded on screen and came
  back unfolded.

- Panning a board or a map writes the canvas layers in the event that moved
  them rather than a frame later. The per-frame work (the grid, the overview,
  the selection bar) is still done once a frame, which is what that deferral
  was for.


- The view toggles are one size again. The same two-button icon switch drew
  its icons at 15.64px on Notes and 14.72px on Library, the Timeline and
  Reminders, because the segmented control set no label size at all and each
  strip inherited whatever was around it. Every choice control is now on the
  one control-label size; the sub-tab strips, which are navigation rather
  than a control, keep theirs.

- The Boards & maps dashboard widget shows a board, not a box in a box. Its
  thumbnail was a 40.5px square drawing its own border and fill, with the board
  letterboxed inside it at the board's real shape: 7.6px of empty band above
  and below, inside a second border, and 59% of the box was the picture. It is
  the same 72 by 40 the Library's own board rows use now, with one frame and
  85%. A board's item count also stopped calling its text boxes "images".

- The one square tab in the app is round. Swept every visible element's corner
  radius on all ten tabs: the main strip was never square, and the only
  tab-like control computing 0px was the Documents sidebar's, whose hover
  painted a hard-edged grey rectangle clamped to the word next to a rounded
  collapse toggle.

- The chat composer no longer opens wearing a focus ring. Reported as a panel
  shadow; it was the dock's own accent ring, lit by the focus the app puts in
  the composer so you can arrive typing. The caret still lands there, the ring
  waits until the focus is yours.

- Dark mode answers the Appearance sliders. Measured at 5% and 40%: the
  shadow-strength slider moved every shadow in light and none in dark, the
  sheen slider the same, and the small-raised shadow had no dark value at all,
  so it was a blue-violet ink on a near-black page. Default appearance is
  unchanged; the controls now reach both modes.

- A dropdown is as tall as the room under it. The whiteboard's View and Arrange
  menus were capped against their button's bottom while having already been
  moved higher up the window, so at 1440x700 the View menu scrolled 594px of
  content through a 505px port with 89px of window to spare. Nothing is clipped
  and nothing is short at 900, 700 or 600.

- Ctrl+S reaches the code written for it. A shortcut binding on the same keys
  answered first, so with Settings open it saved the note composer behind the
  modal instead. It now presses the visible section's Save button, or rings the
  nav button for a section that saves as you change it, and the ring is drawn
  on top of the control's own shadow rather than replacing it for its duration.

- The dashboard's Continue pill shows the note again. It is twice the width of
  its neighbours so it can carry the note's first line, and a later rule had
  hidden that line: 68.7px of the word "Continue" centred in a 535px pill.

- "Describe with AI" is asked for a description rather than a transcription.
  Handed two thousand characters of a document and told to describe it, a
  small local model very often gave back the opening of that document,
  lightly reworded. The prompt now rules that out in as many words and asks
  what the file contains, not only what it is about.

- The spelling menu's suggestions read as words again. Every candidate drew
  the same check mark, so five suggestions looked like five identical
  commands and the eye had nothing to tell them apart by except the text it
  was meant to be comparing. The candidates are now bare, with the first in
  bold, and the check mark is kept for the panel's own apply button.

- The Graph's toolbar fits on one row again at laptop widths. Its three zones
  wanted nine pixels more than the row had at 1024, so the whole actions
  group, including the tab's primary action, dropped to a second line with
  667px of empty space beside it. The "Concept maps" link keeps its icon and
  gives up its label below 1200, which buys back 111px.

- A note reference in an answer now says which note it opens. Reported: an
  answer described a bubble tea note, called it "note #68", and the link
  opened a Shakespeare parody. The link was never pointing at the wrong
  place; the model had written an id belonging to a different note, and the
  app repeated it as a citation without saying so. The note's own first line
  is now shown beside the reference, so a mismatch is visible in the sentence
  rather than one click later.

- The Dashboard shows something on a phone. Its "Start something" tiles were
  a one-column grid at 390px (two columns needed 370px of the 364px
  available, so the layout fell back to one by six pixels), which made a
  323px tower and pushed the first widget to y=870 on an 844px screen:
  nothing on the page was above the fold. The tiles now scroll sideways like
  the row beneath them, and the first widget starts at y=624.

- The AI edit history and document history dialogs open centred. They were
  1440px wide against the left edge of the window, because the page-column
  rules reach any direct child of a page and a dialog written there took the
  column's width and margins instead of the centring every other dialog gets.
  Reported three times.

- Pressing a button that centres itself no longer makes it jump. The chat's
  jump-to-latest pill moved 68px to the right for as long as the mouse was
  down, measured; so did anything else placed with a transform, because the
  press cue set `transform` and replaced the placement instead of composing
  with it. Reported twice, for two different buttons.

### Changed

- The two segmented bars in popups (the document assistant's Edit / Write /
  Remove, the graph's layout picker) read as the segmented control they already
  were. The selected option was a 14% accent tint behind body-coloured text
  with a drop shadow under it, at 12px in a 26px segment, where every other
  segmented control in the app paints a solid accent behind white. The bar is
  also as wide as its options now: 209px, from 686px of well holding 161px of
  them.

- Buttons look like buttons again. A tonal button (`button.ghost`, most of
  the app) draws a hairline edge and sits slightly proud of its surface;
  a flat tint with no rim reads as a shape with text in it, which is what
  three reports in a row said. A *run* of them inside something that already
  frames them stays quiet and lights up under the pointer: a dock, a
  whiteboard panel, a card's row actions. Measured: a note list used to put
  52 outlined boxes on one screen, now none, and the largest run of tonal
  buttons anywhere is five.

### Added

- Reading a file with the AI shows up in Settings, Background tasks.
  "Describe with AI", the local OCR pass and the vision read were all
  invisible while they ran: the button went quiet and the panel that lists
  background work showed nothing, so on a slow local model the only evidence
  anything was happening was that the app had not answered yet.

- The documents editor checks spelling against a real dictionary. It used to
  look each word up in a hand-written table of 42 typos and treat everything
  else as correctly spelled, so an ordinary mistyping was never flagged and
  the only mark under it was the browser's own squiggle, which the app cannot
  see and cannot open a menu on. A 92,972-word English list is vendored under
  `frontend/vendor/wordlist/` with its licence, loaded lazily on the first
  prose pass, 252,926 bytes over the wire. Code fences, inline code,
  addresses, link destinations, html tags, note links and frontmatter are not
  read by any of the prose rules, and acronyms, identifiers and anything
  touching a digit or a path are never checked. Measured over 8,000
  characters of this project's README: six findings, no false positives.
- Suggestions for a flagged word come from the dictionary, ranked by how
  specific the edit is, so "tets" now offers "test" first rather than not
  offering it at all.

### Fixed

- An emptied mind map is no longer a dead end. Reported: "if i delete all
  nodes in a mindmap, I cant make more nodes". Every way of adding a node
  hung off a node that was already there, so a map with zero nodes offered
  nothing; it now shows one sentence and one action that makes the first
  topic, in place of the whiteboard's own help panel, which talks about pens
  and shapes.
- A map keeps at least one topic: deleting the last one is refused at both
  delete paths, and the refusal offers "Clear the map", which takes the whole
  map away and leaves one blank topic ready to type into.
- The documents editor's suggestion menu reads down its left edge. The rows
  had inherited the shell's centred button layout, so each icon sat 29, 30 or
  31px from the row edge depending on how long its label was; they line up at
  7px now. The menu also caps its height and scrolls, which it needs now that
  a real dictionary can fill it.
- Markdown markers in the rendered view stay down until someone is in the
  editor. A document nobody had clicked in showed its first heading's "#",
  because an untouched editor's caret sits at offset 0 and a marker on the
  caret's line is revealed by design.
- Tab in the documents editor indents a list item from wherever the caret is
  in it, rather than pushing two spaces into the middle of the word, and
  Shift+Tab pulls it back instead of moving focus to the dock. Reported: "I
  can't press tab to indent without it selecting an element." Shift+Tab with
  no selection also leaves a caret now, where it used to select the whole
  line it had just dedented.
- Autocorrect in the documents editor works again. It had one caller, the
  delegated input listener, which returns early for anything inside the
  CodeMirror view, so the feature had not run since the editor changed
  surface. It also fixes an unambiguous typo the dictionary knows about
  rather than only the 42 in the table, and its correction is now its own
  undo step: one Ctrl+Z used to take back the whole sentence.
- The documents formatting toolbar's single scrolling row no longer clips its
  icons: the horizontal scrollbar's own strip was coming out of the existing
  bottom padding rather than being added beneath it. Measured at 520px wide
  with the scrollbar rendering: 58px tall against a 36px control, 13px under
  the buttons, where it was 50.8px with about 2px clearing the scrollbar.
- The wrapping toolbar no longer spills its second row over the document. A
  `min-height` on the strip replaced the automatic content floor a flex item
  gets from `min-height: auto`; it is now scoped to the scrolling row, where
  the content is always one control tall and the floor can never bite.
- An empty chat composer can be dragged taller. The rule that forgets a
  dragged height on an empty box was firing on the release of the drag
  itself, so the gesture undid itself and an empty composer could not be
  resized at all.
- Dropdowns no longer flash in the top corner before landing. Placement was
  computed from the opener's rect without checking it had been laid out; an
  all-zero rect collapsed the arithmetic to the margin in both axes. It now
  retries once on the next frame, held invisible rather than painted in the
  corner.
- Menu heights are no longer capped from an un-laid-out rect. Measured with
  the whiteboard tab hidden, every board menu reported `top: 0` and was
  given an 892px cap on a 900px viewport; a stale large `top` is the same
  bug in the direction that produces an overly short menu.
- A dropdown inside a native `<dialog>` (the documents dictionary's spelling
  picker) opened behind the dialog: the menu escaped to `<body>`, which is
  outside the dialog's top layer. It now escapes to the dialog itself.
- The dictionary dialog's spelling picker and "Add a word" button are one
  height again.
- `[[wiki links]]` to a document whose title has since changed, or was
  shorter when the link was written, now resolve by prefix as note links
  already did.
- "Describe with AI" on a scan the AI reader had already read no longer
  re-captions a raw page: `vision_ocr_text` was missing from the fallback
  chain.
- A note dragged from the Library onto a whiteboard lands where it was
  dropped. The drop point was measured against the layer that already
  carries the pan and zoom as a CSS transform, then had the same transform
  applied to it a second time.

### Changed

- A mind map has its own dock rather than the whiteboard's. The pen,
  highlighter, eraser, fill, the six shapes, the sticky, the free text box
  and the image are hidden on a map (13 of the 22 tool buttons could do
  nothing a map understands); select, pan, lasso, the link tools, delete and
  undo/redo stay. In their place: add topic, add child, add sibling,
  collapse or expand the selected branch, branch colour and focus, the
  gestures that until now were keys and nothing else.
- Branch colour can be set. The renderer has carried a node's colour down its
  branch since the map's second phase and nothing in the app could choose
  one; it now sits in the map dock, with "Reset the colour to the branch" on
  the node's own menu.
- The quick-nav guide ("m") stays open until dismissed, by pressing "m"
  again or its new close button, rather than hiding on a 900ms timer.
- Line numbers leave the view menu: numbering is a toggle, not a view. Plain
  view now numbers by default, since it is the view with no grammar and no
  decorations, and an explicit off still wins.
- Plain view gets a plain black or white ground, painted behind the editor
  rather than fighting CodeMirror's own stylesheet.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-09

**0.3.0 is the modernisation release.** Everything on the branch since
0.2.2 (2026-09-06 to 2026-09-09): a canvas graph with colour rules, groups,
lasso and export; mind maps through Phase 5 with previews and generation
from notes; the documents editor's new chrome and CodeMirror 6 vendored
under the CSP; launchers, uninstallers and a splash on three platforms; the
glass aesthetic scoped to the functional layer with Performance mode;
grounding that names the note each sentence came from; a README and
documentation written for the public; and about forty of the owner's
reported bugs. The detail, by surface, follows; the tag is cut once
this lands on main (docs/RELEASING.md).

### 0.3.0, by surface

Every non-merge commit on `claude/epic-ramanujan-8xocc0` since 2026-09-06,
not already covered above or in [0.2.2], one line each, no hashes. Pure
roadmap bookkeeping (INBOX/HANDOVER updates, plan documents, agent-remaining
notes) is not repeated here; see `docs/roadmap/` for that record.

**Graph**
- Phase 1: a Web Worker running d3-force behind one `renderGraph()` entry
  point, a Canvas 2D renderer, a 2,000-note gate fixture and the numbers
  from running it.
- Phase 2: full-screen mode, label collision avoidance (hover and hits
  first, then degree), a scaled spread so a map opens framed, pan no longer
  re-lights a note nobody pointed at, and the display options moved off a
  strip and onto a dock gear/popover.
- Phase 3: colour rules and groups.
- Phase 4: lasso selection, a selection dock, a right-click menu, session
  hide, saved views moved into the More menu (9 controls down to 6), PNG
  export at 2x with the legend, and Play on the time slider.
- The options panel holds up on a phone and a short window, and fits
  1440x900 without scrolling.
- Concept maps get a labelled door in the Graph tab.

**Mind maps**
- Phase 1 (backend): the map object, containment, tree endpoints,
  export/import, four AI tools.
- Phase 2 (frontend): nodes are drawn and a map is editable from the
  keyboard; a new map's root opens centred and edges follow every card a
  bulk drag moves; edges also follow a single node's drag; a map frames
  itself on open and Tidy is measured at 200 nodes.
- A mind map is a node in the graph, joined to the notes on it, and is also
  a note in its own right (`GET /entries` lists it again).
- Import from an OPML or Markdown outline, and export the same way; attach
  a mind map to a chat message as its outline.
- A map node can point at a note, document, file or link, by hand; purging
  a map unlinks its image files.
- No permanent selection box, and a map node's text can be highlighted;
  readable in dark theme and with glass off.

**Documents**
- CodeMirror 6 vendored (`frontend/vendor/codemirror/`, built by its own
  script from pinned versions, licence beside it) and verified under the
  app's CSP; the editor moves onto it next.
- Phase 0: the fifth bug and the states checked, recorded and built.
- Phase 1: the chrome, three questions in three places, plus one header
  row where the formatting strip only appears when asked for.
- Phase 2 steps 2 to 4: the editor *is* CodeMirror 6 now, behind one
  adapter (`docSurface()`), loaded the first time a document is opened.
  Live preview renders in place instead of in a second pane, with the
  markdown markers hiding themselves until the caret enters what they mark,
  links and `[[wiki links]]` as chips, task checkboxes that tick, callouts
  and quotes with a left bar and images shown; Source is the same editor
  with the rendering off, so switching keeps your place, your selection and
  your undo history. Find and replace is the engine's panel (regular
  expressions, whole-word, a Replace all that one Ctrl+Z puts back),
  headings fold in the line-number column, and twenty-one languages get
  syntax colouring. Typing in a 20,000-word document went from a measured
  160 ms per keystroke to 16 ms. The per-paragraph Live view, the Phase 0
  backdrop and the snapshot undo stack are deleted with it, and the block
  handle goes with them until Phase 3 brings block structure back.
- The owner's evening batch: the Edit / Read pills fit inside their own
  segment (they overhung it by 4px); `---` and a callout's `[!note]` join
  the markdown markers that go invisible until the caret reaches them, the
  callout showing its kind's own label where its marker was; a **Plain**
  view for using the tab as a plain text editor, offered for code files
  too; line numbers reachable from the view menu instead of only from the
  collapsed formatting strip; and code syntax colours drawn from the app's
  own palette, which is what finally makes a code file readable in dark
  mode (a keyword measured 1.76:1 against the page and now reads 6.47:1).
- The follow-up pass on that batch: `.focus()` on a `<select>` is dead code
  everywhere in this app (all thirteen reachable selects would have focused
  the hidden native control), so `focusSelect` replaces it at four call
  sites; a Live marker reveals when the caret is on its line rather than
  inside its range, which stops the caret jumping 28.4px to the right on a
  leftward keystroke; the documents sidebar's sections are as tall as what is
  in them (243px of empty column gone); every text link in the app stops
  drawing a filled button's accent glow behind its words; and Swift, R and
  INI join the highlighter (+2.5 KB gzipped) while PHP and CSV are refused on
  purpose, with the measurements written down.
- The Outline sidebar reads as an outline: entries left-aligned and
  indented by depth in the direction depth goes, an empty state that says
  what fills it, References with its close button on its own line, and the
  "Where are my documents kept?" help no longer pinned across the bottom
  like a footer.
- The instruments VS Code and Word have that this editor did not: real
  underlines in Source view on a backdrop behind the textarea, one click
  on an underline opens ranked suggestions, a file-type change re-runs the
  prose pass, the caret mirror gets a border, the line-number gutter is
  pinned to the textarea it numbers, and line numbers are one remembered
  setting across all three editors.
- An on-request AI review ("Check with AI") for what the local rules
  cannot judge, and inline AI at the caret (`/ai`, Ctrl+J, a wand in the
  selection bar) instead of a side panel.
- A document-local undo stack that spans Live and Source; Live view stops
  dropping the caret.
- The findings chip is a control and the switches moved to the kebab; the
  preview waits for typing to pause.
- Undo for deleting a document, the one permanent loss left in the app.

**Whiteboard**
- Text formatting on boxes and stickies: bold/italic/bullets, alignment,
  toggleable rendered markdown.
- Top-bar menus escape the panel that was cutting them off; the five
  whiteboard menus become one measured menu; pan desync fixed.
- Captioning for documents, not photographs; the lightbox shows a document
  like a document.
- Outline a region on a page and read or describe just that.

**Chat and Ask**
- The chat mode is called Agent, and a skill can switch to it.
- Citations land on the answer a run actually ends with (the inline
  citations were being written and then thrown away).
- Grounds answers in the notes the tools actually read, and in a note's
  distinctive words.
- Ground the Help chatbot in real facts; Help gets its own mini AI chat
  (Help → "Ask the guide").
- A "still writing" pill floats over the transcript instead of taking a
  row, doubling as jump-to-latest, and keeps working after the live turn
  is re-parented.
- The chat box gets a "/" menu of its own commands.
- Chat can attach what the notebook already holds, and attached documents
  finally reach the model.
- Tool results are typed cards; a failed plan step is re-planned, not
  abandoned; a step cut off mid-job is stopped, not re-planned.
- **Tensions**: the notebook finds where you disagreed with yourself,
  reachable as an agent tool, a skill, and from the command palette.
- `read_file` can target a search term instead of only the first ~2000
  characters; `list_documents` and `get_document` got the matching fix.

**Notes, Library and Files**
- Notes carry a space chip, and capture says where it is filing.
- The Files sub-tab is a reading list: a "Read · N words" badge, a primary
  read/open action, and a Read/Not-read filter; the OCR workspace finds its
  own siblings (Images/Files/Pages) and every entry point populates it.
- OCR readings are kept as they complete, split into typed sections without
  Tesseract, deletable on their own, and a Stop button plus a Background
  tasks row while a read runs.
- Ask the notebook about itself: most common tags, busiest categories,
  untagged notes, most-linked notes, when you write most, word counts,
  longest notes, stale notes, tags that keep turning up together, all
  counted from your data with no AI running, and surviving a misspelling.
- Archive extended to chats and documents, alongside notes.
- A "Read · N words" badge on chat images already OCR'd; Contents says what
  a folder is instead of "(written here)"; the Library fits a phone.

**Chat, Notes, Documents copy and small fixes**
- Mark a notification unread, per row, plus "Mark all read".
- "Ask the AI for wordings" in the document suggestion menu.
- Double-tap the chat composer's resize corner to reset its height; the
  composer can be dragged and stops at 40vh.
- Several routes between two notes at once (Yen's K-shortest paths), each
  in its own colour; "Generate story from path" becomes a menu of six
  shapes.
- The onboarding "Your setup" slide warns when the notebook folder has
  gone read-only.

**Dashboard**
- The widgets dialog no longer paints closed behind the hero; the hero
  banner is restored and refined, with the primary start tile tinted
  rather than inverted.
- The toolbar gets breathing room and a name; rearranging now saves; two
  new widgets.

**Settings and the popup agent**
- Performance mode (Effects & accessibility): flat panels, no animations
  and slower graph physics, auto-on for a machine with 4 cores or 4 GB or
  fewer or when the OS asks for less transparency, said once in a toast.
  With the animated background on, cards still frost it.
  Glass itself now blurs only where something scrolls under a surface or
  where it floats (the top bar, sub-tab strips, dialogs, docks, popovers):
  the blurred area at rest fell from a third of the screen to under a tenth.
- The popup agent gets a slot beside the Ctrl-K hint, on by default and
  hideable like every other slot.
- One integrated toggle row everywhere (switch leading), replacing the
  divider-separated grid.
- Ctrl+F searches the Settings dialog and jumps to the answering section;
  the About page reads as a hierarchy again.
- Settings → Packages installs, reinstalls or removes dictation, the
  desktop window and search-by-meaning without a terminal.

**UI modernisation, phases 0-9**
- Phase 0: the sweep runner, screenshot set and signature ratchet.
- Phase 1: one gutter for the shell, two card sizes, a one-row hero, one
  head row.
- Phase 2: buttons on the ramp, two row gaps, one popover shell, one tile.
- Phases 3-4: glass on the shell only, one control size, tone-only hover,
  one focus ring.
- Phase 5: Settings nav and label column, the reminders form rhythm, a
  Voice pass; Settings fits a phone at 390px; Notes and Chat fit a phone.
- Phase 6: one voice, sentence case on every label, every empty state
  offers its next step, every piece of text clears AA contrast in both
  themes.
- Phase 7: line numbers as one remembered setting; the caption/read
  pipeline described above.
- Phase 8: every top dock becomes one bar, applied surface by surface
  (Graph, Library, Notes, Timeline, Reminders, Whiteboard, chat header).
- Phase 9: the phone pass, breakpoint by breakpoint, down to a one-column
  layout, safe areas, hover gating and a working jump list on a phone.
- Keyboard: every tablist walks with arrow keys, Home and End; a
  roving-tabindex pass informed by it.
- Glass, three passes: one token recipe for every surface, a lit rim that
  costs nothing, and a fifth of the blurred layers left, none nested.

**Launcher, installer and uninstaller**
- `start-desktop.bat` no longer fails after the update check with
  `"...\--desktop" is not recognized`: the launcher captures its own path
  before parsing flags, since SHIFT moved %0 along with them.
- The splash's step marquee sits under the step text instead of across it.
- `start.sh`/`start.bat`/`start-desktop.sh`/`start-desktop.bat`: one flag
  set, a doctor, a log for every run, and a splash screen shared by all
  three surfaces.
- `--doctor`, `--logs`, `--shortcut`, `--port`, `--reinstall` and friends
  now behave as documented, including a flag typed without its value
  failing with a message instead of silently killing the script.
- The uninstaller: a dry run with sizes, an `--export` (fixed to work with
  no path given), and a guard against deleting under a running app; the
  freed-space figure now counts the notes that actually went.
- The launcher must not die because it could not open its own log.

**Backend, security and CI**
- Backend hardening: SQLite pragmas and indexes, one error contract,
  media size handling.
- Add `GET /debug/health` (PLAN.md B9) and a Health block in Settings →
  About.
- The session token is redacted from uvicorn's access log; Markdown links
  in notes go through a scheme allow-list; the API schema is behind the
  unlock.
- Several CodeQL findings closed: cyclic imports, no side effects inside
  `assert` in the learned spec, unused regex dropped from an audit script,
  wrong keyword arguments in spec tests, `py/import-and-import-from`.
- Every `.py`/`.js` file in the app's own code and tests: no em-dashes,
  enforced by a lint that cannot match its own needle.

**The final day, 2026-09-09**

Written after the rest of this section, which stopped at that morning. A
hundred and forty commits landed on the last day, from four agents and the
orchestrator; these are the ones that change what the app does.

- **Graph.** A drag places a note and lets the map settle around it; Shift
  and drag pins, which reverses a decision the code defended at length (the
  reason is in GRAPH_PLAN). Tree, radial and arc are read-only for position:
  no pinned ring on every node, and a double click no longer releases one
  into the simulation and pulls the layout apart. The node panel's close
  button stays on its line beside an ellipsised title, its actions became a
  centred footer band, and the suggested-links list shows note names instead
  of raw markdown. The lightbox opens above full screen, and full screen
  keeps its glass when the animated background is on.
- **Mind maps and boards.** A board is a board and a map is a map in the
  Library, not two notes with a pencil icon. The OPML and FreeMind exports
  are iterative and cycle-guarded: a 1,200-node map raised a recursion error
  before, and a map containing a cycle ran 200,000 rows without stopping. A
  map's edges are drawn in their branch colours, which a new lint caught on
  its first run. Board and map previews draw real shapes at real sizes with
  every label inside its shape.
- **Documents.** Plain and code views with line numbers and syntax; rule and
  callout markers hide until the cursor reaches them; setext headings reach
  the outline; the Outline sidebar indents by one step instead of three and
  reads left; the Edit and Read pills fit their control. Code in the dark
  theme was measured at 1.76:1 for keywords and is 6.47 to 13.52 now.
- **Files.** A document describes itself from its own text when it is
  attached, on a background thread, so a Files row says what a file is
  without being asked; the description is a summary rather than a
  transcription, and it needs no vision model. A document's title opens the
  reading workspace. The expanded reading no longer closes itself every six
  seconds.
- **Chat.** A citation's number and its row in the Sources panel are the
  same number, which they were not: the two counted from unrelated
  sequences. An angle-bracket URL renders as a link. The token badge reads
  "used / window" and keeps its size at every width.
- **Everywhere.** Ctrl+S saves the settings section that is on screen and
  marks the button it pressed; the zoom readout appears over dialogs; a menu
  a panel owns no longer counts as a click away from it; the whiteboard's
  selection rectangle draws above the cards; the Arrange tools sit in three
  named rows; a dialog taller than the window scrolls to its last line
  instead of losing it, which the keyboard shortcuts overlay had been doing
  to its whole "Always available" section, whose chord rows now read as keys
  then description rather than one flex item per key; nine settings sections trade walls of prose for help popovers;
  the glass sheen slider drives something for the first time. The Library's
  Contents dock keeps one row at 1024 and at 820, where it wrapped in both
  themes: Collapse all sits in a `...` menu and the four-way segment folds
  below 1100 like every other dock's, the same answer the boards dock took.
- **The suite and the tooling.** A lint fails the build on a merge conflict
  marker in any tracked file; another fails on an SVG paint attribute a
  stylesheet would silently override, now also when the class is assigned
  through a ternary or a template, with a browser sweep covering the
  descendant-selector half no text scan can see; `scripts/gate.sh --changed`
  runs the
  lint set plus the tests naming the files you touched, and the full suite is
  no longer run as routine, because CI runs it unselected on every push. The
  health budget times its fastest sample rather than the median, so it
  measures the endpoint instead of the machine's load.

## [0.2.2]: 2026-09-07

### Recorded late (shipped in 0.2.2, listed under Unreleased until 0.3.0 was cut)

### Added
- **Groups for saved links, with buttons to make and manage them.** The Links
  sub-tab's top dock now has **New group** and **Manage groups**. Renaming a
  group moves every link in it; deleting one keeps the links and simply
  ungroups them. A group you make before filing anything into it is remembered
  until a link lands there.
- **Document history.** Every version a document has had, with who changed it,
  how many words it gained or lost, the opening of that version, and a way to
  read or restore any of them. A stretch of editing coalesces into one entry
  rather than one per autosave, so the list reads as sittings rather than
  keystrokes. Restoring keeps the version it replaced.
- **Ask the notebook about itself.** "What are my most common tags", "which
  categories have the most notes", "how many notes have no tags", "which are my
  most linked notes", "when do I write most" are counted from your data rather
  than generated: exact, instant, and answered with no AI model running at all.
  Private and binned notes are never counted.
- **"Ask the AI for wordings"** in the document suggestion menu: where the
  built-in checks have no mechanical fix, the local model offers two or three
  alternative phrasings to pick from. Nothing changes until you choose one.
- **OCR readings are kept.** A page read is stored as it completes, so a read
  that finishes after you close the workspace is still there when you come
  back, and a range read that is interrupted keeps the pages it managed.
- **The OCR reader picker offers both AI readers** where a machine has two
  different models, a dedicated document reader and a general vision model,
  instead of one option named after whichever it happened to resolve.
- **Mark a notification unread**, per row, plus "Mark all read".
- **"Edit document"** on a previewed document in the lightbox.
- **A "Still writing" pill** in Chat when you scroll away from a live answer,
  doubling as jump-to-latest.
- **Double-tap the chat composer's resize corner** to reset it to the automatic
  height.
- **Help → "Ask the guide"**, a small embedded AI chat for "how do I…"
  questions about the app itself. Answers with the utility model, grounded
  in a fixed set of reference notes (`ai/help_chat.py`'s `HELP_TOPICS`) so a
  small local model isn't guessing at features it has never seen, never
  reads the user's notes, and keeps no history past the current browser
  session. Replies can carry quick-access badges into the exact tab or
  settings section they describe.
- **Onboarding's data-dir writability check.** `GET /storage` now reports
  `data_dir_writable`, and the "Your setup" onboarding slide warns if the
  notebook folder has gone read-only.
- **Document editor: "Check with AI."** Sends the current document to Chat
  with a prompt asking the model to flag wording issues a spellchecker
  can't catch, agreement, tense, clarity, without rewriting the document.
- **Archive extended to chats and documents** (BACKLOG §30b's own named
  remaining scope, after notes got this first). An "Archive" action beside
  Delete in the chat sidebar and the documents dock, kept, never deleted,
  out of the way, and the Library's Shelved filter now covers all three
  kinds.
- **The popup agent in the status bar.** It works from every tab and had
  nothing on screen saying so. Now a slot beside the Ctrl-K hint, on by
  default (the ask was discoverability, and a control nobody switches on
  advertises nothing) and hideable from Settings like every other slot.
- **A Stop button for OCR page and range reads**, and both now appear in
  Settings → Background tasks while they run. A read is a model round-trip
  of several seconds that could not be cancelled and showed up in that panel
  nowhere, so closing the workspace mid-read left no sign the app was still
  working.
- **Inline AI in the document editor.** `/ai` in the "/" menu, Ctrl+J, and a
  wand in the selection bar open a small bar at the caret instead of a side
  panel: type an instruction, the answer replaces the selection (or writes at
  the cursor) and lands *selected*, with Keep / Try again / Undo underneath.
  No new endpoint: the existing `POST /documents/{id}/ai-edit`.
- **Several routes between two notes, not just the best one.** The graph's
  Trace panel now finds up to three genuinely different, loopless routes
  (Yen's K-shortest paths) and draws all of them at once, each in its own
  colour, with switchable chips above the readout.
- **"Generate story from path" is a menu of six shapes**, narrative,
  explainer, timeline, argument, teaching notes, short brief, instead of one
  fixed prompt.
- **The Files sub-tab is a reading list.** Every file tile carries a
  "Read · N words" / "Not read" badge and a primary "Read this" / "Open
  reader" button, plus a Read/Not-read filter.
- **The OCR workspace finds its own siblings and switches between them.** An
  Images/Files/Pages switch above the rail, and every entry point (including
  the lightbox, which previously opened to an empty rail) now populates it.
- **Sections without Tesseract.** A stored reading is split into typed blocks
  (heading/list/table/code/text, read off their own shape) instead of one
  whole-page fallback region, and each region shows which page and section it
  came from.
- **Delete a stored OCR reading**, not just overwrite it by reading again,
  `DELETE /{files,media}/{id}/page-reads/{page}` plus a "Delete this reading"
  action in the workspace. Redo already worked (a re-read replaces the stored
  answer); its button now says so.
- **Ask the notebook about itself, in more ways, and past a typo.** Word
  count, longest notes, notes gone stale, and which tags keep turning up
  together: and every question now survives a misspelling ("catagories",
  "docuemnts") against a small fixed vocabulary, transpositions included.
- **Undo for deleting a document.** The one permanent loss left in the app,
  notes, chats, files and boards were all recoverable, a document was not.
  All four delete doors now offer Undo.
- **A refresh button on the Your Notes sub-tab**, matching the one every
  other Library list already had.
- **A "Read · N words" badge on chat images that have been OCR'd.** The
  caption already showed under the thumbnail; the vision-OCR/Tesseract
  reading was resolved by the backend the whole time but nothing in the
  bubble said it existed. Clicking the badge opens the same lightbox the
  picture itself does.
- **`read_file` can target a search term.** A new optional `query` argument
  returns the text around where it actually appears instead of only the
  first ~2000 characters: a multi-page scan's later pages were previously
  unreachable through this tool no matter how precisely `search_files` had
  already located the match. `list_documents`'s search preview and
  `get_document`'s no-embedding-backend fallback got the same fix.

### Fixed
- **The chat sidebar never marked the open conversation.** A `null` passed as
  the highlight terms threw inside the Sources panel, which aborted
  `openConversation` before it repainted the sidebar, the click worked, the
  transcript rendered, and an unrelated null check stopped the row from ever
  being marked. A third of each row was also dead to clicks, and the mark it
  would have got was a 3px bar and a 13% tint.
- **The chat header's model name opened its panel off the bottom of the
  window**: `position: absolute` with no positioned ancestor put it at (0, 905)
  in a 900px viewport, which is indistinguishable from a control that does
  nothing.
- **A page read that finished after the OCR workspace was closed was lost**,
  even though the app announces such reads as background tasks precisely so the
  window can be closed.
- **The OCR picker and the OCR reader disagreed about which model would run.**
- **The gallery's per-image select checkboxes could not be clicked**, the
  actions row above them stretched across the tile and swallowed every click.
- **The lightbox could not be dismissed by clicking beside the picture**, and
  its close button was covered by the content column on taller documents.
- **The streaming indicator froze and, on a long answer, vanished.** Its
  animation timer destroyed itself the first time the live turn was re-parented,
  and one beat in four of the reduced-motion cycle lit nothing at all.
- **Nineteen buttons drew a typed character where an icon belonged**, and
  eleven more had no gap between icon and label. Two lint tests now refuse both.
- **Twenty-five icon-only buttons were rectangular**, including nine popup close
  buttons measured at 43.6x28.
- **The formatting toolbar's dropdowns un-clipped the whole toolbar**, spilling
  every control past the panel edge.
- **Files and attachments did not render in the timeline or graph popups**,
  both filtered to images and dropped everything else.
- **The dashboard greeting could call you by a misspelt or invented name.**
- **The note cards' ⋯ glyph sat above centre**, drawn as a typed character
  where the app's other ⋯ builder uses the icon font.
- **Deleting a document failed** once it had a history, on a foreign key.
- **Restoring a document version restored the wrong text**, the snapshot taken
  first coalesced into the very revision being restored. Caught by a test
  before it shipped.
- **Short background AI jobs were invisible.** The status loop idles at 10s
  (120s in a hidden tab) and can only announce a job it has seen in a
  `/tasks` payload, so an image caption, often shorter than that gap,
  began and ended unobserved: no "Started" line, no status-bar slot, no
  "Finished" toast. Writes that can leave work on a background thread now
  kick a poll, and `jobsRunning()` counts every task rather than only
  re-index and model pulls.
- **Formatting-toolbar dropdowns escaped their panel.** Measured in the
  capture composer: the Insert menu sat 123px outside the panel's left edge,
  because `.doc-dock-menu-list` is anchored `right: 0` and grows leftwards:
  right for the document ⋯ it was written for, wrong for an opener near the
  left of a toolbar. Clamped inside the panel on open.
- **The OCR workspace's reader picker named the wrong model.** It resolved a
  generic vision model instead of the configured or auto-detected OCR
  document reader, so a dedicated reader could never be chosen even when
  installed.
- **One toggle row everywhere in Settings.** `.setting-check` was a
  divider-separated grid with the switch pinned hard right; it is now the
  same integrated, filled-when-on row with a leading switch that the rest of
  the app uses, which moves the tools list and the appearance outliers
  together.
- **Attached non-image files rendered as nothing** in dashboard widget note
  lists, and the widget picker listed "On this day" twice.
- **Toolbar dropdowns in the capture and documents toolbars opened up to
  151px from the button that opened them**, and after that, in the top-left
  corner of the panel, three related bugs in the same placement function,
  in the same viewport-fixed-menu change: wrong alignment axis, no
  containing-block correction, and a zeroed fallback on a failed measurement.
- **The traced graph path's chips clipped from both ends** ("ting is the
  delivery of computing se"), a flex item that could not shrink, centred in
  its box, overflowing equally on either side; `text-overflow` on the parent
  button never touched it.
- **A misspelt "ask the notebook about itself" question fell through to
  ordinary semantic search**, which is precisely the case that feature exists
  to answer better: and one new question's own pre-filter accidentally
  rejected it before any matcher saw it.
- **`clampToolbarMenu`'s CodeQL-adjacent cousin**: three cyclic imports
  (one already a CodeQL alert, two more of the same shape unreported)
  closed and pinned by a new AST-based lint.

### Verified
- **A real (non-Ollama) backend, driven live for the first time.** A
  stand-in OpenAI-`/v1` server (a real socket, not a mocked `requests`)
  proved `/help/ask`, `/voice/summarize` and a full `/chat/stream` turn:
  SSE framing included: all round-trip correctly through
  `OpenAICompatClient`, the dialect LM Studio/llama.cpp/Jan/vLLM share.
  Tool-call streaming remains spec-verified only; see HISTORY.md §113.

A bug-fix and consistency release, from one long round of live reports.

### Fixed
- **The formatting-toolbar dropdowns rendered as transparent, block-flow
  text.** The previous release's hide-until-placed fix for menu flicker split
  the rule wrongly, leaving the menu's whole appearance (flex column, padding,
  border, background, shadow) behind the `.is-placed` class: and because the
  placement code gives up when a menu measures 0x0, that class was then never
  added. Self-sealing, and it affected every `<details>` menu in the note
  capture, note edit and document toolbars.
- **Turning the background librarian off did not stop the pass already
  running**: nor did battery-saver mode. Both now request a stop, which the
  pass honours at its next checkpoint instead of finishing first.
- **Agent-activity notices ignored both the mute switch and "Panel only"**
  whenever they carried an error. The notifications centre records them
  either way, so nothing is lost by not interrupting.
- **A PDF read page by page showed "No text yet" everywhere outside the OCR
  workspace.** The per-page readings are now joined into the file and media
  list responses, in page order, with a whole-file reading still winning.
- **Chat: scrolling up left the pane stuck** with the answer cut off until
  "Jump to latest" was clicked: `scroll-behavior: smooth` on a pane written
  to every frame turned each auto-scroll into an animation competing with the
  wheel.
- **Chat: every finished answer step kept its blinking caret** during an agent
  run, and the caret sat on a line of its own whenever an answer ended in a
  list.
- **The spaces switcher in the top bar was shorter than everything beside
  it**: 28px against 36px for the tabs and the five icon buttons.
- **The whiteboard's view dropdown had a horizontal scrollbar**, and long
  dropdown menus could run off the bottom of the window instead of scrolling.
  Every popover menu is now capped to the window height and scrolls inside
  itself.
- **A horizontal scrollbar on Notes → Capture**: measured at three widths as
  exactly the scrollbar's own width of phantom overflow, plus a head row that
  crushed its own controls by 30px.
- **Model names in badges were clipped at both ends** (centred flex text
  cannot ellipsis) and carried their `hf.co/` registry prefix.
- **The OCR model never showed as "in use"** in the installed-models list.
- **Document line numbers drifted** against a soft-wrapping code pane.
- The selection tick was hidden under the page render on Files rows in
  preview view; sticky rows painted a hard rectangle over their own card.

### Fixed
- **A mind map's branches are the colours it says they are.** Every edge on
  every map was drawn in the accent, while the same map's thumbnail showed the
  branch colours correctly.
- **A very deep mind map exports.** A long enough branch used to fail the
  download with a server error, and a map whose parents form a loop could hang
  the export instead of finishing it.

### Changed
- **The Boards and maps toolbar fits one row on a laptop**, with the two
  import and generate actions behind its ⋯ menu.
- **A board's preview looks like the board.** Things are drawn at their own
  sizes instead of as identical grey blocks, text boxes and map nodes show
  what is written on them, and the dashboard's miniature is a thumbnail again
  rather than a 300px square that made the widget scroll.
- **The dashboard's top band uses its whole width**: a Continue pill that takes
  you back to the note you were last in, and a fortnight of activity drawn
  beside the counts, where two thirds of two rows used to be empty.
- **Every skill on the dashboard says when it last ran**, so you know before
  spending a model call.
- **Pressing "m" shows a full-screen guide** to what the next key does, instead
  of a notification that wrapped mid-word, and three more keys do things:
  settings, a quick sketch and meeting notes.
- **The activity heatmap is legible**: it starts full width, and its squares are
  four times the size.
- **Back to top appears sooner on the dashboard**, which is the page you scroll
  furthest down.
- **Glass reads like glass in dark mode.** A card sat at almost exactly the
  page's own brightness, so the blur had nothing to separate it from; it now
  sits above it, measured.
- **On a small laptop or an iPad the tabs are icons**, so the header is one row
  again rather than two, and every tab is still one press away.
- **A bar with content moving under it says so.** The top bar, a dock or a
  sub-tab strip fades a soft edge beneath itself while the list under it is
  scrolled, and paints nothing at rest.
- **Menus open out of the button that opened them** rather than appearing
  beside it, and stay still under Reduce motion.
- **All seven tabs are reachable on a tablet in portrait.** Between 600 and
  820 pixels the strip used to need more room than its row had, so two tabs
  sat behind a fade; the captions and their padding step down there instead.
- Anything rounded inside a rounded container follows one token, so it stays
  concentric at every setting of the corner slider.
- Tab indents four spaces where a file type has no convention of its own.
- Zoom feedback is a HUD, not a notification, so muting no longer hides it.
- One menu shell app-wide, matched to the note-card kebab menu.
- Stop buttons all carry the stop icon and the error colour.
- Tighter shell: one `--page-gutter` (ceiling 24px → 18px) for the page edge,
  the sidebar gap and the top, and one gap under both sub-tab strips.
- Surface tiers and a border budget, one button ramp, one eyebrow recipe,
  see `docs/roadmap/UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md` for what remains.

## [0.2.0]: 2026-09-05

A long round driven almost entirely by live reports with screenshots. Two
defect *shapes* account for most of the visual bugs in it, and both are
written up at the top of `docs/roadmap/HANDOVER.md`: a CSS recipe that names
its members explicitly and silently drops any control that never enrolled, and
`border: none`, which leaves the width at `medium` for an `!important`
border-style rule to resurrect as 3px.

### Added
- **An OCR workspace.** A page beside its regions: a page rail, the image with
  a clickable box per block Tesseract found, and the text of each block with
  its confidence, one selection shared both ways. `core/ocr.py` gained
  `extract_regions`; `GET /media|files/{id}/ocr-regions` serve it. Fit and
  Actual size, because a portrait scan in a landscape pane was getting cut off.
- **A vault keeps its shape when imported.** `Entry.source_path` holds the
  vault-relative path, `[[wiki links]]` resolve by **filename** (which is what
  Obsidian links name), the Contents index gained a By-folder mode, and
  Settings gained a folder picker beside the file picker.
- **The Contents sub-tab is a real index**, sticky sections, a filter, a jump
  bar, folding, grouping by category, tag or month, rather than a masonry of
  boxes with a scroller inside each one.
- **A selection toolbar** in both editing surfaces, and the note *edit* form
  (the app's poorest editing surface) gained the toolbar, the "/" menu and the
  selection bar it never had. Documents now open in Live view.
- **Live action lines in chat**: each tool call names what it touched, as chips
  that preview the note in place with Open and Edit.
- **Sorting on every Library sub-tab**, and a Cards/Rows switch on Boards.
- **A rebuild-the-search-index suggestion** after a bulk change, rather than a
  standing notice nobody reads.
- **Favourites** as a parallel pseudo-category, integrated everywhere.

### Changed
- The Images/Files gallery kebab is the app's own `kebabMenu()`, it was a
  second implementation of one control, which is how it drifted three times.
- The widgets picker shows Wide as a state, marks Remove as destructive, and
  can be reordered from the keyboard.
- Deleting a file can take its `![...]()` out of the notes that showed it.

### Fixed
- A document chip in chat opened a *note* with the same id.
- A tool row with chips vanished from a reopened conversation.
- Drafts could link to saved notes.
- The Files sub-tab's kebab existed but was invisible and unclickable behind
  the page preview.
- Attached (not embedded) images never appeared in widget rows.


## [0.1.9]: 2026-09-04

### Added
- **A note's attached files can be read.** An attachment now carries a
  caption, extracted text and a vision-model transcription of its own,
  columns `MediaUpload` has always had and `Attachment` never did. One
  endpoint (`POST /files/{id}/analyse`) covers all three: Tesseract for a
  picture, the document extractor for a .docx or a text-layer PDF, and a
  vision model rasterising pages for a scan or a diagram with no text layer
  at all. Any of the three can be typed over by hand.
- **Files show a preview.** A PDF tile renders its own first page.
- **The file gallery multi-selects**, with a count and bulk delete, matching
  the Documents sub-tab.
- **A whiteboard selection can be saved straight to the image library** as a
  PNG, with no file downloaded on the way.
- **The user has an avatar in chat**, alongside the assistant's emblem.
- Ask's two panels have real heads, and the tab says what it does before its
  first use instead of being an input on an empty card.

### Changed
- **Semantic search knows how a note is filed.** A note's category, its tags
  and the text of anything attached to it are part of what gets embedded, so
  "what do I have under hobbies" is a question the vectors can answer.
  Existing notes need a re-index to benefit; new and edited ones do not.
- **One help popover for every "?" in the app.** Three different
  presentations (a floating card, a static bordered paragraph that pushed the
  page down, and bare inline text) are now one anchored, caret-pointing
  popover that no card's overflow can clip.
- The Ask box reads as a single composer rather than five loose controls.
- Image caption and OCR fields read as fields rather than shouting labels,
  and the model that wrote a caption is a badge rather than a bare id.

### Fixed
- **A PDF's pages no longer disappear when you read its text**, pages on one
  side, the extracted text on the other.
- **Popup menus clipped in many places, not one.** Every `<select>` in the
  app now escapes its clipping ancestor; the escape mechanism itself gained
  the z-index and width fixes that only showed up once it was used inside a
  modal.
- **A note's attached PDF never appeared in the Library**, because the
  gallery only ever queried one of the two file tables.
- Agent rows printed their icon spec as text ("ph:folder Merged …").
- Whiteboard link endpoints drifted away from the cursor while zoomed, the
  zoom scale was applied twice.
- Usage chips printed raw markdown instead of a readable line.
- A turn that is still generating now says so for as long as it runs, rather
  than only until the first stream event.


### Added
- A formatting toolbar for the Notes composer, matching the document
  editor's: bold, italic, code, lists, links, plus highlight, a highlight
  colour, a text colour and Remove formatting. Both toolbars share one
  markdown table, so they cannot drift apart.
- Text colour in notes and documents: `++red|text++`, in eight colours.
- Selecting text in any editor now offers the actions menu (it previously
  only worked on rendered content), including Highlight with a colour.
- Similar notes can be turned into real links in place, from both the
  editing panel and the "Similar notes" action on a note card.
- Suggested links now get an AI-drafted reason automatically, which you can
  edit before accepting.
- Settings: automatic image captioning and automatic text-reading (OCR and
  vision model) can each be turned off. Both stay on by default.
- Settings: a Regenerate button for the dashboard's welcome message.
- Text highlighting now supports named colours: `==green|text==`
  (yellow, green, blue, pink, purple, orange).
- Settings → Personas: a "Regenerate greeting" button for the dashboard
  welcome message.
- The image gallery's OCR and vision-OCR text is collapsible like the
  caption, and the lightbox shows who described an image, not just who
  transcribed it.
- Text highlighting in notes and documents: `==highlighted text==`, an
  inline markdown convention rendered everywhere note/document content
  already renders (no new data model).
- A "generate suggested reasons" action for the Graph tab's pending link
  suggestions, filling in empty "Why?" boxes via the AI.
- A "Clear" button for the AI Skills sidebar's run log.

### Fixed
- The navigation-history popup: it capped at 12 entries with a count of
  what is not shown, and its rows no longer clip their own text.
- Editing a saved link now opens one inline form with the title, URL and
  group together, rather than two dialogs in sequence.
- The image gallery's actions menu closes when you pick something, instead
  of staying open over the rename field.
- The AI Skills step list numbers no longer collide with the panel edge.
- The Graph options divider no longer crowds the time read-out.
- Local scripts and stylesheets are versioned, so an upgrade cannot leave a
  browser running the previous release's files.
- **Notes are filed by the AI again.** Auto-categorisation used to return
  on a close vector match and only ask the model if that failed, so in an
  established notebook the model was almost never consulted and notes landed
  in the wrong category. The model is now asked first; the semantic paths
  remain for when no model is running.
- The navigation-history popup was unreadable: its background was 4%
  transparent so the page showed through, and its rows were pinned shorter
  than their own text so every glyph was clipped to a sliver.
- The AI Skills sidebar is now the height of its own panel instead of
  overflowing past the bottom of the screen.
- Long words and URLs no longer overflow the edge of an image-gallery card.
- The nav-history popup's cramped spacing, a cut-off last row, and an
  overly-narrow popup for short entries.
- The Library sub-tab menu bar now matches the Notes sub-tab bar's card
  styling and corner rounding (was picking up a global rounding rule by
  file-load order, since it never set its own `border-radius`).
- Markdown document previews in the lightbox used the translucent card
  background instead of the near-opaque modal one.
- `#search-help` and `#capture-help` now close on outside click/Escape via
  the shared toggle helper, and share the floating popover style used
  elsewhere.
- A stray horizontal scrollbar in the Library Contents outline was cutting
  off text and its hover highlight.
- The AI Skills tab's step/tool fact list had no visual container.
- The Graph Options toggles (and two more elsewhere in Settings) now use
  the same pill styling as other toggles instead of a bare switch.
## [0.1.7]: 2026-08-31

### Added
- **Links**: a bookmark shelf for websites, in a new Library sub-tab,
  save a URL, group them (a free-text group with a "/" convention for
  sub-groups, e.g. "Work/Reading"), filter by group or search text, pin
  favourites to the top. Saving a URL you already have warns rather than
  silently duplicating it.
- **References**: a note or document can now attach a saved bookmark,
  shown live in its editor (next to the note's related-notes panel, or the
  document's Outline sidebar), with a picker to attach one and a one-click
  way to remove it.
- **Contents**: a new Library sub-tab with a hyperlinked outline of the
  whole notebook, grouped by category or by tag, click a note to jump
  straight to it. The fast, scannable companion to the Graph tab's spatial
  view, not a replacement for it.
- The Library "All" tab's create button now opens a "What would you like to
  create?" picker when the active filter has no single obvious answer
  (Everything, Files, Tags, Drafts, Activity, the bin), instead of always
  defaulting to a new note.
- A global Ctrl+F find bar that works on every tab.
- The image/document lightbox gained a real actions bar (zoom, copy text,
  save), drag-to-pan while zoomed, document previews (not just images), and
  the gallery's AI actions (caption, extract notes).
- A related-notes panel that updates live while editing a note, not just
  when you click to reveal it.
- The AI can now read a note's attached files (PDFs, code, text) when that
  note is hand-attached to a chat turn, previously only attached pictures
  were read; other attachments were invisible to the model.
- Meeting-note transcripts get an AI-generated "Decisions" / "Action items"
  summary block prepended automatically when saved as a note, best-effort
  and non-blocking if the model is unavailable.
- `tags:<N` filter syntax, for finding notes with fewer than N tags.
- Pre-save tag suggestions when writing a new note, not just after saving.
- The Timeline gained a thread-line view (threads rendered as tributaries).
- Whiteboards gained bring-to-front / send-to-back for shapes.
- Graph traversal is now weighted by link type and confidence, and a
  double-click node pin persists across reloads instead of resetting.
- Per-stage token accounting, surfaced in the chat metadata line.
- The Library's "All" grid, the Documents sub-tab, and the Reminders tab's
  Done group are now paginated instead of rendering everything at once.
- A status-bar clock detail popover (seconds, date, timezone) and a
  navigation-history popup on the status bar's Back/Forward buttons, plus
  back/forward keyboard hotkeys.
- A "?" syntax guide on the capture composer, matching the one already on
  the notes filter.

### Fixed
- An attached chat document's extracted text never actually reached the
  model: the attachment showed in the composer but the AI couldn't see it.
- A private note could leak its content via `restore_note` while the vault
  was locked.
- The Documents kebab dropdown's real transparency bug (not a z-index issue,
  the background itself was never opaque).
- Whiteboard boards could vanish entirely once emptied of shapes.
- OCR picked the wrong model by priority in some configurations; Tesseract
  availability is now surfaced instead of failing silently.
- The lightbox's zoom-out cursor bled into its info panel.
- The Timeline thread view's band labels overlapped their own dots; lanes
  now space dynamically so dense clusters can't bleed into a neighbour.
- The "Your notes" filter help button (and the capture composer's own "?"
  button) didn't match the app's other circular help-toggle buttons, first
  a markup/class mismatch, then, reported again, a `.library-toolbar button`
  CSS rule silently overriding the circle's height back to the toolbar's
  shared control height while leaving its width alone, stretching it into
  an oval. Both are now fixed.
- The chat composer's file picker accepted types the backend would then
  reject; the two lists are now kept in sync and pinned by a regression test.
- Several real Settings/Skills spacing bugs found by a live measured audit,
  and the Library's context-aware create button now follows the active
  filter instead of always creating a plain note.
- Settings → Logs' "View Logs" button called a function that didn't exist.
- The graph's force simulation kept running in the background (burning CPU)
  after leaving the Graph tab.
- The gallery's kebab menu could render off-grid and get clipped.
- The Documents dock row's alignment, and every scrolling tab strip now
  fades at its clipped edge instead of cutting off abruptly.
- Several CodeQL alerts closed: a path-injection sanitizer, an exception's
  raw text reaching the user, and related lint findings.

## [0.1.6]: 2026-08-30

Follow-on fixes and features added to the 0.1.5 branch after that release was
tagged, ahead of the PR merging.

### Fixed
- A `keydown` handler on the graph map hijacked keystrokes typed into a note's
  popup or the "Grow the map" form: Space/Enter reopened the wrong note
  instead of typing a space or submitting. Now ignored while the event target
  is an input, textarea, select, or contenteditable element.
- An unhandled exception anywhere inside `run_agent`/`run_skill`, outside the
  cases those functions already caught themselves, killed the chat stream
  with zero rendered output. Both the first-event fetch and the per-payload
  drain loop are now wrapped, so a real failure still reaches the user as an
  answer instead of a silently dead connection.
- The Image Gallery's kebab menu could render off the right edge of the grid;
  replaced a `nth-child(3n)` heuristic with a measure-and-flip listener.
- The AI Skills page was unusable below ~900px (fixed two-column grid, a
  sticky sidebar with nowhere to go).
- A private note's new "decrypted" audit-log entry could fire while the vault
  was locked: `readable_content()` returns a placeholder, not the real text,
  when the vault has no key, so a locked-vault read logged a decrypt that
  never happened.
- `<summary>`-based icon buttons (the kebab/ellipsis menus) were off-centre,
  the centring CSS selector only ever matched `<button>`.
- The "Your themes" section in Settings → Appearance had a `-stack` class
  that only overrode `align-items`, not `flex-direction`, so a row with more
  than two children never actually stacked.
- The llama.cpp extra's "unavailable" message implied the app doesn't talk to
  llama.cpp at all; it already does, via `llama-server`'s OpenAI-compatible
  API: only in-process `llama-cpp-python` embedding is unbuilt.
- The Capture tab's "File under" row could run its later buttons off the
  card's right edge instead of wrapping, `.capture-field-row` claimed to
  wrap but never set `flex-wrap: wrap`.
- The Image Gallery's kebab button had square corners: the base `button`
  rule's `border-radius` never reaches a `<summary>` element (it is a
  `<details>` disclosure, not a real button), the centring fix above this
  same element already got was never joined by one for its corners.
- The lightbox's prev/next arrow icons sat visibly off-centre, inherited
  padding (`0.5rem 1rem`) the sibling close button already resets shrank the
  centring box to less than the glyph's own width, and CSS Grid's "safe
  centre" fallback shifted the oversized glyph to the padding box's edge.
- A tool call a model wrote as text instead of using the structured
  tool_calls field (small/local models do this routinely) silently failed
  to recover whenever its `arguments` were themselves an object or array,
  an entirely ordinary shape, because the fallback regex could not match
  across a nested brace. Replaced with a real brace-balanced scanner.
- `PUT /preferences` logged an audit-log ("Activity") row for every key
  changed, `ui_state` (the interface's entire theme/appearance state behind
  one key) included: a slider drag read identically to changing the model
  backend. Cosmetic/one-shot keys no longer write an audit row; the
  preference itself still saves exactly as before.
- The Library's Activity cards clip long entries at 400 characters
  server-side with no way to see the rest, clicking one with nothing to
  jump to (most of them) now opens the full, un-clipped text.
- The image gallery's popup menu could still run off the *left* edge on a
  narrow (single/two-column) gallery: the existing flip logic only ever
  corrected right-edge overflow. Now clamped back into bounds after the
  flip decision, regardless of which edge or how narrow.
- `renderLibraryDocuments()` and `renderLibraryBoardsGallery()` overwrote
  the Library's empty-state element's `textContent` on every render (to
  show a "no search match" message): harmless while that element was a
  plain line of text, but it silently erased any richer markup put there
  instead. Found while giving those two subtabs the same icon+title empty
  state "All" and Image Gallery already had (below); the "no match" case
  now has its own sibling element instead of overwriting the real one.
- The "Detailed" response length preset could come back with no answer at
  all, or a much shorter one than promised, the same shared
  thinking/answer token budget already documented as a risk in
  `test_thinking_budget.py` ("1,024 shared between deliberation and answer
  is the same trap in a larger size"). Detailed's own prompt explicitly
  asks the model to reason through the notes, inviting more deliberation
  than Normal or Quick, but got the same flat 1,024-token thinking
  allowance as both: a verbose reasoning model given more to think about
  and no more room for it starved its own answer. Detailed's allowance is
  now 3,072 tokens.
- The launcher's PowerShell splash (`scripts/splash.ps1`) never called
  `[System.Windows.Forms.Application]::EnableVisualStyles()`, without it
  WinForms renders every control with the classic, unthemed renderer, and
  the classic renderer does not animate a Marquee-style ProgressBar at all,
  regardless of its colours (a second, independent cause of the "bar just
  stays empty" symptom already fixed once by removing its ForeColor/
  BackColor). Not verified live: this sandbox has no Windows/PowerShell
  runtime to run it on; the fix is standard WinForms practice and matches
  the documented behaviour, but say so plainly rather than claim it's seen.
- The boot splash (`#boot-splash`, shown for the one `/auth/status` round
  trip on every page load) had three bouncing dots but nothing that read as
  progress. Added a bar that crawls toward ~90% on its own and snaps to
  100% the instant the real request resolves, so it never claims to finish
  before the work behind it does.
- The Library's "Activity" filter chip could land alone on its own row,
  looking like a stray pill under the others, `.library-chip-activity`'s
  `margin-left: auto` (meant to push it to the end of the row) fights
  `flex-wrap` the moment the chips before it don't all fit on one line, and
  a wrapping auto-margin item gets shoved onto a lonely row of its own. The
  chip is already last in DOM order, so the divider alone does the job;
  dropped the margin.

### Added
- `notebook_overview`, an AI tool combining `list_categories` + `list_tags`
  + `count_notes` into one call: a skill wanting "the notebook's shape"
  (Notebook health check, Tidy suggestions) needed three round trips for
  numbers this app already had cheap SQL for.
- `llama-server`'s own `/props` is now probed as a context-length source
  (ROADMAP.md item A.2): a real number (the `-c` it was started with) in
  place of the guess-from-model-name table, for plain llama.cpp servers
  that report neither `loaded_context_length` nor `max_context_length`.
- Exporting a single note as a `.md` download (`GET /entries/{id}/export.md`),
  mirroring the document export that already existed, a "Download .md"
  item on a note's overflow menu and its Library card menu.
- A tip under the custom-template textarea (Settings → Templates) saying
  `{date}` resolves to today's date: the substitution already worked for
  any template (`applyTemplate()` does a plain string replace), including
  user-made ones; it just wasn't discoverable without reading the source.
- The Library's Documents, Whiteboards, and Image Gallery subtabs now get
  the same icon+title empty state their "All" sibling already had, instead
  of a bare line of muted text (BACKLOG.md §95 item 16).
- A plain-language "what this means for you" line under Settings → Models'
  spec table, computed from the model's real context window (BACKLOG.md
  §95 item 2).
- Settings → Background tasks' finished-jobs list now shows which model did
  the work (captioning, OCR, the autonomous pass), when the job recorded
  one: the data already existed, it just wasn't rendered (BACKLOG.md §95
  item 3).
- macOS gets a launch splash too now, a non-modal `display notification`
  banner (never steals focus, unlike `display dialog`) showing the same
  phase text the Linux/zenity dialog already showed. Asked for directly.
- Recency and pinning are now a search-ranking signal (BACKLOG.md §95 item
  6): hybrid search's candidates are reordered by pinned-first /
  most-recently-touched and fused in as a third ranked list, the same rank-
  position fusion the existing semantic/keyword combination already uses,
  never a new source of matches, only a reorder of notes a real search
  already found relevant.
- The Quick sketch pad's highlighter had no visible transparency, "basically
  a thick pen." `sketchMove` kept extending one open canvas path with
  `lineTo()` and calling `stroke()` on every pointer-move without ever
  starting a fresh path, so `stroke()` re-drew the *entire accumulated path*
  each time, not just the newest segment, a stroke ten points long got its
  first segment recomposited ten times. Invisible on the plain pen (opaque
  drawn twice is still opaque) but at the highlighter's 0.35 alpha, ~10
  overlapping passes already reads as ~99% opaque. Fixed by reopening the
  path from the current point after every stroke, so each call draws its one
  new segment exactly once. Verified by sampling canvas pixels before/after
  a multi-point stroke: the repeatedly-touched start and the once-touched
  end now composite identically.
- CodeQL alerts on `main` (user-pasted screenshots): #289/#290
  (`py/path-injection`, High): a second fix attempt for this same alert
  still didn't close it; researched CodeQL's actual sanitiser model
  (`Path::SafeAccessCheck`'s only recognised Python shape is a bare
  `x.startswith(base)` as a guard's sole condition) and simplified
  `_within_exports` to match it exactly, dropping the compound condition
  and computed `+ os.sep` argument that likely broke pattern recognition
  the second time. #296 (information exposure through an exception,
  Medium): `routes_chat.py`'s error-fallback path sent a raw exception's
  `str()` straight to the client; now goes through `safe_value`, the same
  sanitiser `librarian.model_error_message` already uses for the identical
  shape. #319 (duplicate `import re` in a test function), #320/#321
  (mixed implicit/explicit returns in `ollama_client.py`/`openai_client.py`'s
  retry-loop `chat()` methods: added an unreachable trailing raise so the
  function reads as exhaustive).
- Three more Preferences toggles ("Mute notifications except reminders",
  "Let the AI use this profile...", "Allow web search when I ask for it")
  had the same bare-`<label>`-missing-`.check-row` bug as Settings → About's
  five: swept the whole file for the pattern (`<label>` directly wrapping
  a checkbox, no class) rather than trusting the one page already fixed was
  the only one.
- Settings → Help's "Related" links could only ever open another Settings
  section: a topic about a real *tab* (Reminders, Graph, Library…) had
  nowhere to send you but a settings screen that only tangentially mentions
  it. Added `[data-goto-tab]`, the same delegated-click pattern as the
  existing `[data-goto-section]`, closing the modal and switching tabs
  directly. Wired up for every topic with a real tab to go to (Capturing
  notes, Asking & chatting, Skills, Graph, Reminders, Dashboard, Library,
  Timeline); Reminders and Dashboard also gained the Settings links they
  were missing (a notification-mute toggle, the dashboard greeting name,
  both in Preferences). Skills, What it remembers, Spaces, Appearance and
  Keyboard shortcuts have no tab of their own, so no tab link was added for
  those: a manufactured one would be worse than none.
- Arrow-key navigation on the command palette (34+ commands, only ~7 visible
  at once) never scrolled the selected row into view past the first
  screenful: confirmed live (15x ArrowDown left the active row off-screen).
  `renderPalette` rebuilds the list from scratch every keypress, so there
  was never a focused/tracked element for the browser's native
  scroll-on-focus to follow; `.active` is a plain CSS class on an unfocused
  `<li>`. Added an explicit `scrollIntoView` after each move; the same
  defensive fix went onto the Notes list's roving-tabindex navigation and
  the `[[wiki-link]]` autocomplete popup for consistency.
- Every `.small.icon-only`/`.small.icon-button` control (Settings modal's
  back/forward nav arrows, plus several search/sort/filter icon buttons
  elsewhere) rendered oversized and square-boxy, 43px next to a 30px
  "Close" button beside it. `.small`'s own horizontal padding
  (01-forms-settings.css, a later file) was clobbering `.icon-only`'s
  intended padding (00-tokens-shell.css) for the shared physical left/
  right sides, whichever file happened to load second winning regardless
  of which rule actually fit an icon button, `aspect-ratio: 1` then
  squared that oversized width into an oversized height too. A compound
  selector fixes it generally (specificity, not file order), reported live
  with a screenshot against the Settings nav arrows specifically.
- Settings → About's five on/off toggles (three Updates, two desktop-only)
  were still bare `<label>` elements with no `.check-row` class: a prior
  pass's own comment claimed they'd been lined up with every other toggle
  in the app, but only the DOM order changed; the actual pill/box/hover
  treatment `.check-row` provides never applied. Reported live with a
  screenshot ("make the toggle lines and buttons the same as the semantic
  buttons or the attached image"). Now genuinely `.check-row`, matching
  Autonomous Background AI's toggle directly above them on the same page.
- A search box and a rename/delete kebab menu on the Whiteboards subtab's
  board cards, matching the Documents subtab beside it.
- An opt-in clock in the bottom status bar (Settings → Appearance).
- Settings → About redesigned into the same boxed sections every other
  settings page uses; Settings → Help's "Settings → X" mentions are now
  real links to that section, plus two new ones for topics that had none.
- The status bar's back/forward now cover opening Settings and moving
  between its sections, not just the tabs and sub-tabs it already tracked,
  including a second copy of the two buttons in the Settings header itself,
  since the modal overlay sits above the status bar's own.
- Meeting Notes as a real Library filter chip (tag-based, alongside the
  existing kind filters), after two non-functional attempts at a sub-tab.
- AI Skills cards: expandable step/tool lists via `<details>`, and the
  "Run in the background" master toggle separated from the two worker
  toggles it gates.
- A way to attach an image already in the library to a note, without
  re-uploading it.
- Backup retention count as a real Settings → Data control (was already a
  hard-coded, always-enforced cap; now a preference, prunes immediately on
  change).
- A Restart button in Settings → About on the desktop build.
- Four missing topics in Settings → Help, and an explicit answer to whether
  the chat has `/` commands (it doesn't).

### Reverted
- A mechanical check flagging a skill step "failed" if its own instruction
  named one of the skill's tools by identifier and that tool was never
  called: real steps that conditionally act on "each X" legitimately call
  nothing when there is no X, and the check could not tell that apart from
  a step that should have called it and didn't. Reverted before merging;
  see HANDOVER.md §97 for what would be needed to attempt this safely.
- Minimise-on-Quit (`js_api=bridge` on `webview.create_window()`): caused a
  real hang on Windows, a recursion storm in `window.native` COM property
  access on the WebView2 UI thread. Fully reverted; root cause confirmed,
  not re-attempted this release.

## [0.1.5]: 2026-08-30

A correctness and cost release. The headline items are a chat bug that could
file an answer under the wrong conversation, a prompt that spent more on tool
schemas than on the user's own notes, and a Restart button that killed the
packaged app.

### Fixed: a chat turn could be saved into the wrong conversation

`chatConv` is reassigned when you switch chats, and every save read it *live*,
at each checkpoint and again when the turn finished, minutes after the send. So
switching mid-stream wrote the finished answer into whichever conversation was
open when it landed, or made a new one out of it. Visible only as the message
and the generating bubble vanishing.

A turn now pins its conversation and only touches the header, usage meter and
composer while that conversation is on screen. Leaving one mid-answer keeps the
live nodes and re-attaches them on return, so the reply continues in front of
you rather than appearing all at once at the end, and the notice names the
thread that is actually being answered instead of the one you just left.

### Fixed: the tool-call disclosure was permanently open

A chip rendered as its label with the entire raw result stuck to it. The
disclosure was built correctly; `.tool-chip-body` set `display: flex`
unconditionally, and an author rule beats the user-agent rule that hides a
closed `<details>`. It collapses now: one line, click to see the arguments and
the result.

### Fixed: the glass sheen made dialogs unreadable in light mode

The sheen used the `background` shorthand, which re-declared the fill as
`--card` at a specificity that beat `.modal-card`'s deliberately near-opaque
`--modal-bg`. Turning the sheen on quietly reverted every dialog to full page
glass. It layers as `background-image` now, and is halved in light mode where a
white sheen on a near-white surface only flattens it.

### Fixed: an off toggle switch looked like a blank gap

The track was 7% alpha inside a 10% border: invisible on a card, so an unchecked
switch read as empty space. Reported twice, on the semantic-search and
smart-model-routing controls.

### Fixed: Restart from the tray killed the packaged app

`os.execv(sys.executable, [sys.executable, *sys.argv])` is right from source,
but in a PyInstaller build both are the .exe, so the executable's own path
arrived as a positional argument and argparse exited, with no console to print
to. Open and View Logs also failed to raise the window when it was merely
behind something.

### Added: advanced response settings, detected per model

Top-k, top-p, min-p, repeat penalty and the repeat window, in Settings →
Models. Values start at what the model itself recommends: a GGUF ships its
author's parameters and Ollama reports them in `/api/show`, which the app was
already fetching and discarding. Each row says whether a number came from the
model, the task, or you, and only what you change is stored, so switching
model still picks up the new one's recommendations.

### Added: a separate OCR model, and scanned PDFs that actually read

Rasterising a PDF does not read it; it makes a picture a model still has to
read. A general vision model describes an invoice, a document reader
transcribes it: so OCR has its own setting, and automatic mode prefers an
installed reader (GLM-OCR, DeepSeek-OCR, PaddleOCR-VL) over a general VLM.

`core/pdfpages.py` supplies the pages, behind an optional ~16 MB extra. The
path had never once executed before: `docview.extract` has always taken a
vision reader and its only caller passed nothing.

### Added: the chat attach button takes any file

Images to the gallery as before; anything else is imported as a document with
its text extracted. Four verified OCR models were added to the suggested list.

### Added: a splash during the pre-launch work

The git pull, venv build and pip install all happen before Python exists, so no
window could cover them. Now one does, on Windows and on Linux under zenity.

### Changed: the prompt costs a quarter less on a small model

Measured on an 8k window with eight notes and no history: 32% of the context
before the conversation started, with tool schemas costing nearly twice the
user's own notes. Now 23%. Schemas are trimmed before any tool is dropped,
dropping one changes what the app can do, and the tool guide has a short form
below 8k.

### Changed: tool selection reads words, not substrings

`ai/toolwords.py` replaces substring matching, which offered the tag tools for
"my vintage camera" and the link tools for "blinking lights". It ranks rather
than gates, tells a question about a capability from a request to use it, and
stays a suggestion the model may overrule, reaching for an unoffered tool now
widens the set for the rest of the turn.

### Changed: a 500 on the tools path falls back instead of failing

Ollama answers 400 for a model that declares no tool support, but a model whose
chat template breaks answers 500, common on community re-quants. The app now
retries the same request without tools to tell that apart from a real outage,
and falls back to a plain answer rather than failing the turn.

### Fixed: two buttons wired to nothing

Settings → About's "Take tour again", and the Whiteboards Reload button. After
accounting for ids built at runtime there are now zero interactive elements in
the page without a handler.

### Fixed: whiteboard panels collided below 1180px

The tools row and the zoom cluster shared the bottom edge; by 900px the tools
row ran off the canvas. Verified clean at eight viewports from 1920 to 600.


### Fixed: the Documents Library sub-tab looked nothing like the rest of the app

Reported bluntly and repeatedly: "SOOOO ugly and not consistent with the
other application design style." Root cause, found by screenshotting it
beside the "All" library view: its rows had no scoped CSS at all, so every
one fell through to the app's default filled button style, a solid-accent
bar with the title and word count crammed onto one line. Given a document
icon and a proper card look (border, hover state, title/meta on separate
lines) matching the rest of the Library. Verified in both themes.

### Added: back/forward now covers switching between saved chats

Opening a different saved conversation, or starting a new one, is now a
real history step: Back/Forward restores the right chat. Fixed a genuine
async-ordering bug in the process: `stepTabHistory` now awaits
`openConversation` on that branch, because `openConversation` calls
`recordTabVisit` itself only after a network fetch, without the await,
every Back/Forward through a saved chat would have recorded a spurious new
entry rather than being a no-op. Caught live via Playwright before it
shipped.

### Added: onboarding can pull a model and seed example notes

The first-run tour's "Your setup" slide now makes two one-click offers,
neither automatic: download a starter model when Ollama is running but none
is installed, and add five short, linked example notes when the notebook is
genuinely empty: so the Graph, Timeline and Dashboard have something to show
before your first real note. Seeding refuses server-side on any notebook
that already has a note, so it can never run twice or land on top of real
work.

### Added: "Build a skill", a built-in skill that writes skills

Interviews you about a job you do often, what it should do, whether it
touches your notes, what should be fill-in-the-blank each run, then saves it
as a real skill with `save_skill`: ordered steps and an actual tool
allowlist, not a paraphrase saved as a sentence. Checks `list_skills` first
so a near-duplicate ask reuses or refines what's already there instead of
shipping a second copy.

### Fixed: the "AI isn't available" pill could be wrong while Ollama was up

`/models/status` used to probe Ollama twice on every poll, `is_running()`
and `list_models()` both hit its own `/api/tags`, which could take up to 7s
combined against the frontend's 5s abort on that exact call. One reachability
check now does both jobs, and the frontend's timeout has real headroom above
the new (lower) worst case instead of racing it at the wire.

### Fixed: the agent's "View" button after deleting a note pointed nowhere

A destructive result reused the same navigation as every other change, which
only ever looks in the ordinary notes list, a note the agent just moved to
the bin was never there, so the button silently found nothing. It now opens
the Library's own Bin filter and highlights the note there, which is the one
place a binned note actually lives.

### Added: a minimap and saved views for the Graph

A minimap in the corner of the map shows every note at once with a rectangle marking what you're currently looking at; click anywhere on it to jump there, keeping your zoom level. Alongside it, **saved views**: name a combination of layout, colouring, filters and position, and come back to it later. Both were the missing half of "the graph is a tool" once a notebook gets dense enough that the force layout stops being readable.

### Added: the Library search box can search by meaning

Notes match on meaning as well as words, the same way the Notes tab already worked. Documents, chats, images and skills still match on their words, they have no embeddings, and the toggle says so rather than implying more than it does. Turning it on can only ever add results, never remove one.

### Added: chat history can expire

Saved chats had no retention policy at all and grew forever. Settings → Preferences now takes a number of days after which old chats are deleted. Off by default, and **pinned chats are never deleted, however old they are**.

### Performance: the notes list no longer builds the whole notebook at once

It renders what fits and fills in as you scroll, staying one continuous list rather than becoming pages. On a 1,501-note notebook that took first paint from 533ms to 16ms and the page from 31,680 elements to 4,306. The Library grid does the same.

### Fixed: 49 icon-only buttons were unnamed to a screen reader

Buttons across the whiteboard, sketch pad, document toolbar and status bar announced only as "button". A re-scan found 56 such buttons, not the 13 previously recorded.

### Fixed: several controls were too small to tap reliably

Measured across every tab: a tag chip one pixel under the 24px minimum, two toggle labels four pixels short, the Library's per-card selection tick at 13×13, and a link in Settings.

### Fixed: dropdown panels trapped keyboard focus

The previous release made every dialog trap Tab inside it, which was right for real dialogs and wrong for the notifications panel, the note picker, the graph popups and the help panels, those sit over a page that stays usable, so focus should be able to leave them.

### Fixed: the Agent Activity panel took a third of a phone screen

On the Graph tab in particular, where there is no way to scroll it out of the way, it left barely a third of the screen for the map. Its log area is now compact on narrow screens; it still scrolls, so nothing is lost.

### Added: the text-selection popup is now a kebab, with nine actions instead of three

Highlight text anywhere in the app and a single ⋯ appears; clicking it opens a menu that stays inside the window, flipping up or sideways near an edge rather than running off it. It now offers *Save as a note*, *Save as a draft*, *Add to a note…*, *Save with its source* (when the passage came from the web reader, a quoted clipping with a link back), *Copy*, *Search the notebook*, *Set a reminder*, *Extract notes…* and *Ask the AI about this*. The old three-button bar could not fit on a phone screen, never appeared for a touch selection or a keyboard one, and had no room to grow.

### Added: the selection menu is reachable without a mouse

A long-press drag on a touchscreen now raises the kebab (the popup listened for `mouseup` and nothing else before, so touch selections raised nothing at all), and a new rebindable `Ctrl+Shift+E` opens the menu for a selection made with Shift+Arrow.

### Fixed: the selection popup could render off the left edge of the screen

The clamp that was meant to keep it on screen was nested the wrong way round, so a popup wider than the viewport, which the old three-label bar was, on any phone, ended up at a negative left position instead of pinned to the margin.

### Fixed: arrow keys did nothing in most of the app's ⋯ menus

Arrow-key navigation was written inside the note card's menu specifically, so every other kebab menu, saved conversations, the sidebars, and the new selection menu, had none, even though they announce themselves as menus to a screen reader.

### Fixed: eight dialogs let keyboard focus escape behind them

The confirm and prompt dialogs, the image viewer, note history, the recycle bin, the skill-run panel, the agent command palette and the graph's connection dialog were all missing a focus trap, because the trap worked from a hard-coded list of dialogs that nobody adding a new one knew about. It now recognises any dialog automatically. The image viewer and command palette also gained the dialog semantics they were missing.

### Performance: the note list builds around 76% fewer DOM elements

Every note card was eagerly building its full 19-item ⋯ menu, hidden, at render time, and rebuilding it on every search keystroke, sort change and save. Menus are now built when first opened. Measured on a 1,501-note notebook: 133,748 elements before, 31,680 after.

### Performance: the notebook's list queries are served from an index

The `entries` table had no index on any of the columns its list queries filter and sort by, so SQLite sorted every live note in the notebook on each request. On a 20,000-note database the main list query went from 46 ms to 15 ms; saving a note is 0.02 ms slower.

### Performance: responses are compressed

The app served roughly 2.3MB of uncompressed frontend on a cold load, and uncompressed JSON besides. `app.js` is now 70% smaller over the wire (1071.7 KB → 320.1 KB) and `index.html` 75% smaller. Chat streaming, the weekly digest and the live log are unaffected, they still arrive incrementally.

### Added: a global Undo/Redo system

Two new buttons in the status bar (Undo/Redo), plus Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z, wired into note delete (single and multi-select), note creation, reminder delete, linking/unlinking notes, and note content edits (which covers attaching or removing an image, since that's just a content edit). Session-only, and deliberately steps aside for a text field's own native undo while you're typing in it.

### Fixed: the Ask tab's search-relevance button did nothing

`#ask-search-tune` existed in the markup with the right icon and tooltip, but no click handler was ever attached to it. It now opens the same Settings → Preferences "Search relevance" group its sibling buttons elsewhere in the app already jump to, and sits at the right edge of its row instead of squeezed against the mode chip.

### Fixed: draft notes appearing in Library and Graph

A draft is unfinished by definition, and the Notes tab already excludes drafts from its own note lists, Library's mixed "note" view and the Graph's node list didn't, so an unfinished draft showed up as a first-class card and graph node.

### Security: a real path-injection finding, closed

CodeQL flagged `POST /files/save`'s filename handling (`py/path-injection`) despite an existing whitelist sanitiser; the sanitiser is now built on `os.path.basename` and the write path is checked for real containment inside the exports folder before it's ever used.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed: chat citation badges silently dropped in the Chat tab

The backend already computed per-sentence note grounding and sent a `grounding` event for any notes-related turn, but the frontend only ever rendered it in the Ask tab, the Chat tab never listened for the event at all, so a chat answer that clearly drew on specific notes named none of them. Each chat bubble now gets its own "Grounded in:" chip strip, the same one the Ask tab already had.

### Added: search-relevance help and quick-access links

Settings → Preferences → "Search relevance (advanced)" (minimum similarity, above-average margin) had no explanation and no way in except scrolling Settings by hand. Added a hover tooltip and a click-open panel explaining both numbers, plus three quick-access links, the Dashboard's Tools & Features catalog, the Ask tab's Matching Records heading, and Chat's per-turn matching-notes summary, that jump straight to the setting and highlight it.

### Added: an "Open exports folder" button, and a configurable export location

Graph PNGs, chat exports and the like landed in the app's data folder with only a toast naming the path. Settings → Data now has a button to open that folder directly (desktop app only), and a new preference to redirect where exports are saved, validated as a real, writable folder before it's accepted.

### Fixed: three preferences silently dropped by Settings

`auto_stale_review_enabled` (the autonomous stale/orphaned-note reviewer), `session_idle_ttl_minutes` (Settings → Account's sign-out timer), and `response_mode` (the Quick/Normal/Detailed picker) each had a working Settings control that saved without error but never actually took effect, some were never echoed back after saving (so the control looked reset on reload even though the saved value was in effect), one was never actually accepted by the save endpoint at all. All three now round-trip correctly.

### Fixed: the in-app package installer failing on the packaged Windows build

Reported by a real user: installing "Search by meaning" or dictation from Settings → Packages failed with a cryptic "unrecognized arguments" error and no visible cause. The installer was accidentally re-launching the packaged app itself instead of running `pip`, a mistake only possible in the installed .exe, not a source checkout, which is also the real explanation for two earlier, unresolved "pip install just fails" reports. It now finds a real Python on the system and uses that; if none is found, it says so plainly instead of failing mysteriously. The same fix was needed, and applied, to the SearXNG (private web search) setup process for the same reason.

### Fixed: a missing search-engine component in the packaged build

The packaged Windows app was missing four internal files needed for the optional local web-search engine (SearXNG) to install itself, producing a "module not found" error for anyone who tried. Fixed, and guarded against happening again for any future addition to that engine.

### Fixed: the background-activity notification visibly shrinking the Chat tab

Reported and reproduced live: opening the small "Agent Activity" notification panel while on the Chat tab visibly shoved the whole conversation, messages, the composer, the Send button, up the page. The panel was never meant to overlap the conversation at all (only the chat list beside it), so the leftover spacing rule causing the squeeze was removed.

### Added: a one-click fix when the built-in search engine can't install

If the offline "search by meaning" engine can't be installed (a known limitation on some systems), Settings → Models now offers a single button to switch to an equivalent Ollama-based engine (nomic-embed-text) instead: downloading it and switching over automatically, rather than requiring several manual steps across two different settings panels.

### Changed: the in-chat "Web" toggle now visibly shows when it's off

The web-search toggle in the chat composer looked identical whether it was on or off, which made it easy to overlook that it was left on (or think it was on when it wasn't). It now dims clearly when off, while staying just as easy to turn on.

### Added: automatic updates for the packaged Windows app

Settings → About can now download and install a new release itself, no more being sent back through a browser to redownload and re-run the installer by hand. A popup after login offers it the moment a real release is found (once per version, not every login); Settings → About has the same "Update automatically" action as a manual fallback. Two new, separate switches: whether the app may check GitHub for a release at all, and whether it may apply one automatically once found, turning either off is respected everywhere, including the popup. A "choose a specific version" picker lists recent releases directly in Settings, and a "track the main branch" channel option is now a real, storable preference (main-branch tracking itself still reports honestly as not yet available, no nightly-build pipeline exists yet to make good on it). Every step, checking, downloading, and applying, degrades cleanly when offline or blocked by a firewall/antivirus, and a failed attempt can always be retried, either from the next login's popup or by hand in Settings. Source checkouts (`start.sh`/`start.bat`) already auto-update on every launch via `git pull`; they now default to tracking main (since that's what they're actually doing) and show their own "you were just updated" popup after a real update, using the same mechanism.

### Fixed: a background embedding-model install failure now retries itself

Reported by a real user: when the BGE semantic-search model failed to install, the app fell back to a lower-quality model and stayed there, even after the underlying cause (a transient `pip` failure) resolved itself. A missing `sentence_transformers` package now triggers one automatic reinstall attempt in the background, and search quality recovers on its own once it succeeds, no more permanently stuck on the fallback after a one-off install hiccup.

### Added: search inside uploaded images (OCR), and a search box for the Image Gallery

A whiteboard photo or a scanned page attached to a note used to sit as an opaque file, nothing could search what was actually written on it. Uploaded images now get local OCR text (Tesseract, running entirely on your machine, in the background so uploading never waits on it), and the Library's Image Gallery has a new search box that matches against both filenames and that extracted text, "what was on that whiteboard photo from March" is now answerable by typing a word from it. Entirely optional: without Tesseract installed, images just upload normally with no OCR text, nothing else is affected. Settings → Packages can now install this feature like any other optional extra, and tries to install the Tesseract program itself automatically too (winget/brew/apt/dnf/pacman, whichever this computer has) rather than only pointing at manual instructions.

### Fixed: a security review found two real issues in the new auto-update code, both fixed

`POST /update/apply`'s specific-version picker built a GitHub URL from the requested version without checking its shape first; it now only accepts a real release-tag pattern. A failed install used to report the raw system error, which on Windows could include a local file path; it now reports a safe, generic message while the full detail still goes to the app's own logs.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-23

### Added: Dev view / User view console mode, a terminal-style log view, advanced search settings

A first-run choice, and a live Settings/tray toggle, for whether the desktop app keeps a console window open ("Dev view") or runs with none at all ("User view"). The mechanism is a relaunch, a detached `pythonw.exe` that never allocates a console, rather than hiding one already created, after "hide console" reports turned out to trace to Windows Terminal/ConPTY returning a handle to a hidden pseudo-console host rather than the real window. Settings → Logs gained a List/Terminal toggle rendering the same records as raw console-style lines, the GUI answer to User view hiding the real thing. Settings → Preferences gained "Search relevance (advanced)" (minimum similarity, above-average margin, reset to default) for tuning semantic search directly instead of only via a code constant.

### Fixed: a sign-out bug in the console-mode feature above, found the same session it shipped

The first-run popup could fire before real sign-in, fire again after, and randomly sign the user out. It guarded only on a preference flag that read as "unseen" during a stale-token bootstrap pass (not just "not yet answered"), and it called the same route Settings/tray use to live-restart the desktop process, killing the in-memory session mid-login and racing its own "mark this answered" write against that exit. The popup now requires the preferences fetch to have actually succeeded, and never restarts the process itself.

### Fixed: semantic search returning irrelevant results

An unrelated note scored 57% cosine similarity for an unconnected query. The similarity floor assumed "0 means unrelated," which doesn't hold for the current embedding model (BGE-family, anisotropic: unrelated notes routinely land at 0.4-0.6). Added a second, relative floor from each query's own score distribution, self-calibrating rather than a fixed number.

### Fixed: larger local models timing out or failing to respond

Both the Ollama and OpenAI-compatible clients defaulted their request timeout to 120s, unconfigurable, too short for a cold load of a model past roughly 4B parameters on modest hardware. Raised to 600s, and Ollama chat requests now ask the server to keep a model loaded for 30 minutes of idle time instead of its own 5-minute default.

### Fixed: drafts

The primary Capture box had no way to save a note as a draft at all (only three other, less obvious paths did); it does now. Drafts were also never actually surfaced in the Library despite being documented as such, the sub-tab didn't exist, and, separately, kept showing up in All notes and category views, undercutting the point of a separate Drafts section. All three fixed.

### Fixed: a batch of smaller reports

The Image Gallery lightbox miscounting images when one's backing file was missing on disk; the tool-call output panel in chat truncating to 300 characters for no reason tied to cost (raised to 4000); a long model id pushing the chat header's buttons onto their own row; a form-alignment gap in Capture's "File under" row; the AI never seeing the similarity score or matched keyword terms behind its own search results, despite that data already existing for the frontend's badges.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed: two system tray bugs

Both reported directly, right after v0.1.0 shipped. "View Logs" opened
Settings → Logs unconditionally, reaching straight past the lock screen if
the app was locked, now it only jumps into Settings when `#lock-overlay`
isn't showing, otherwise it just brings the (still locked) window forward.
"Quit" closed the window but left the process running in its terminal,
`window.destroy()` runs on the tray's own thread, not the main thread
blocked inside `webview.start()`, and a cross-thread destroy call isn't
guaranteed to unblock that wait. Quit now hard-exits the process directly,
the same trust `_restart`'s `os.execv` already places in a clean exit
being unnecessary here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added: an allowlist for note attachments

Reported directly: `POST /entries/{id}/files` (the generic "attach a file"
button on a note) had no file-type validation at all, anything uploaded,
video included. `/media/upload` (pasted/dropped images) already had a real
allowlist for a stored-XSS reason specific to that route; this one is
broader (attachments download rather than render inline) but still refuses
video, audio and executable shapes with a clear 415, while covering images,
PDF, common office formats, and text/code files. Audio specifically is
tracked as a real feature to add (BACKLOG §75: capture, playback, a
library page) rather than a permanent refusal.

### Changed: a themed dialog for the document word-count goal

Was a bare `window.prompt()`, functional, but the only dialog in the app
with no app styling, font or theme at all. Reported directly. Now a `card
space-dialog` matching every other small dialog in the app (the space
create/rename/delete ones, the documents-storage one).

### Fixed: three UI issues at the top of the Documents sidebar

All reported directly, with a photo. (1) The document title input had no
floor on how far it could shrink, so on a narrow window it was crushed to
a few illegible pixels before the toolbar ever wrapped its buttons onto
their own row: given a real minimum width, the toolbar now wraps instead.
(2) The four new help-tooltip circles (below) rendered as ovals, not
circles, everywhere except the Graph/Timeline tabs, `--control-h`, the
custom property they sized themselves against, is only declared in a
handful of scopes, and silently resolved to nothing everywhere else,
falling back to `button.small`'s asymmetric padding. Fixed with a literal
size instead of a token that isn't always in scope. (3) The Documents/
Outline pill toggle's "Recent"/"+ New" row was reserving the same
right-side clearance for the collapse toggle that the tab strip above it
already reserves, even though the toggle only ever appears once, "+ New"
sat well short of the sidebar's real edge with dead space beside it. Given
its own clearance instead, plus a little extra beyond the bare minimum for
visual breathing room next to the toggle.

### Fixed: the sidebar collapse toggle escaping to the page's top-left on a phone

Reported directly: the collapse toggle (Notes, Chat and Documents sidebars
alike) could render pinned near the very top of the viewport, over the app
header, instead of in its own sidebar's corner. The toggle is `position:
absolute`; two separate mobile breakpoints set its sidebar to `position:
static` to disable the desktop sticky behaviour, and `static` doesn't
establish a positioning context for an absolutely-positioned child, so the
toggle fell through to the page's own initial containing block. `position:
relative` disables sticky the same way while still containing the toggle.

### Removed: two dead files at the repo root

`find_emojis.py` was an unreferenced one-off debugging script (scanned
`app.js` for stray emoji during a past cleanup pass); `mkdocs.yml`
configured a docs site nothing builds, no CI step, no Makefile target, no
`mkdocs` dependency anywhere, and the real GitHub Pages site is the
hand-built `docs/index.html` renderer. Asked for directly.

### Added: help tooltips on Timeline and the three Library subtabs

Asked for directly, matching the existing Graph tab pattern. The Timeline
toolbar and the AI Skills, Whiteboards and Image Gallery subtabs each had a
permanently-visible subtext paragraph explaining what the screen does;
replaced each with a `?` icon button (native `title` tooltip on hover, a
click-to-open panel for the full explanation) so the space is available for
content on every later visit instead of repeating itself. The four new
toggles and the original `#draft-help` one now share a single
`initHelpToggle()` function in `app.js` instead of four more copies of the
same click/outside-click/Escape listener trio. Verified live: all five
panels are hidden by default, open correctly positioned under their button,
and close on outside-click and Escape.

### Fixed: sketch/attachment images rendering below a note's metadata

Reported directly ("attached sketches are below note metadata"). The note
card built its attachment thumbnails and appended them to the list item
*after* the metadata footer was already appended, so images and sketches
always rendered under the category/date line instead of above it. Fixed by
inserting the attachment row before the metadata element rather than
appending after it. Verified live: attachments now render above the
metadata footer in the note list.

### Fixed: two error-prevention gaps

Asked for directly. `deleteAskHistoryTurn` deleted a Q&A permanently with
no confirmation or undo, its own "clear all" sibling already confirms,
this didn't. Now it does. A reminder's `due_at` could be set in the past
(create and edit both) with no check, silently creating a reminder that
could never usefully fire, `POST /reminders` and `PUT /reminders/{id}`
now reject one more than a minute in the past (a small clock-skew/latency
allowance, not real slack) with a clear 422.

### Fixed: Library thumbnails for pasted/dropped images, not just sketches

Asked for directly ("make the sketches render... the same as how images are
visually displayed"). Found the opposite of the assumed direction: sketches
already got a Library thumbnail (a real `Attachment`), but a note with a
pasted or dropped image, inline markdown in the note's own text, no
`Attachment` row: got none at all, and its title/preview showed the raw
`![alt](url)` syntax literally. Root cause: `routes_library.py`'s
`thumb_by_entry` only ever looked at `Attachment` rows, and `_clip()` never
stripped inline markdown the way `routes_graph.py`'s node-label preview
already did.

Fixed by factoring the shared fix out (`manager.strip_inline_markdown`,
reused by both `routes_graph.py` and `routes_library.py` instead of two
near-duplicate regexes) and adding a `thumb_url` fallback: the note's own
first inline image, same URL shapes the note editor itself already renders
- checked only when there's no `Attachment` thumbnail, so a sketch's own
drawing always wins over anything mentioned in its caption. Extended to the
recycle bin and archive views too, which had no thumbnails of either kind
before. Verified live: a pasted-image note and a sketch note both show
correct thumbnails in grid and list view, with clean (non-markdown) titles.

### Added: pagination for `GET /entries`

Requested directly ("that is a real app feature... probably needed for
real world use"). `GET /entries` was genuinely unbounded: every note in
the notebook, every load, no matter its size. Now takes `limit`/`offset`
(default page 1000, hard ceiling 5000) and reports the true total via an
`X-Total-Count` header. `entry/manager.py` grew matching params on all
three list functions plus three new count helpers, additive, so every
existing in-process caller is unaffected.

`app.js`'s `loadEntries()` fetches pages in a loop, painting the first
page immediately and filling the rest in the background; every one of
`allEntries`'s ~30 read sites needed zero changes, since it still ends up
exactly as complete as it always was once loading finishes. Caught and
fixed in the same pass, by grepping every `/entries` call site rather than
assuming the new default was safe everywhere: three dashboard widgets each
independently re-fetched the whole list and would have silently truncated
past 1000 notes (wrong tag counts, most seriously), now they reuse
`allEntries` instead. Also removed dead code found the same way: `copyLogs()`
built and fetched an `/entries` URL it never used.

Verified live: seeded 2500 notes, confirmed exactly 3 page requests fire,
`allEntries` and the status bar both land on the true total, all rows
render, and the dashboard's widgets show correct totals with zero console
errors.

### Fixed: backend hardening pass

Requested directly ("harden the backend, make sure it's robust"); found by a
targeted audit rather than guessed at, each verified live before being
called fixed:

- `GET /graph/local/{id}?depth=` had no upper bound; the BFS loop ran
  `range(depth)` regardless, so a large `depth` blocked this single-worker
  server's one request thread for real wall-clock time, a trivial DoS on a
  personal-notebook app. Now `Query(ge=1, le=6)`, plus the loop breaks as
  soon as its frontier empties instead of finishing out the range.
- `GET /timeline?days=` had no upper bound either, and fed straight into
  `timedelta(days=days)`, a large enough value raised an unhandled
  `OverflowError` (Python int too large to convert to C int), surfacing as a
  raw 500 instead of a clean error. Now `Query(ge=0, le=40000)` (0 still
  means "everything").
- `POST /import/markdown` capped each file's size but not how many files one
  request could carry, unlike its sibling `/import/document`
  (`MAX_DOCUMENT_IMPORT_NOTES`). Now capped at `MAX_IMPORT_FILES = 500` with
  a clear 422 past that, rather than unbounded work per request.
- Wiki-link resync failures in `create_entry`/`update_entry` were swallowed
  with no logging: the embedding-refresh block three lines above both of
  them explicitly logs on failure ("logged rather than swallowed" is the
  comment right there), and the wiki-link block didn't follow its own
  neighbour's pattern. A real link-resolution bug was invisible in both the
  UI and Settings → Logs; now it isn't.
- `searxng_manager._run_streaming`'s deadline was only checked *between*
  output lines: a child process that went quiet without exiting (a stalled
  download, a hung subprocess) blocked the call forever no matter what
  `timeout` said. Reads the pipe from a background thread into a queue now,
  so the deadline is checked on a real poll loop even when nothing is being
  read. Reproduced the actual hang locally before and after the fix.

### Added: Windows installer

- A real installed build for Windows: `packaging/windows/memorymap.spec`
  (PyInstaller, onedir) and `packaging/windows/installer.iss` (Inno Setup,
  per-user install: no admin prompt). `release.yml` now builds and attaches
  it to the GitHub Release whenever a `v*` tag is pushed. Unsigned for now
  (see README's Windows install note); ships to GitHub Releases only.
- `core/config.py` and `api/app.py` both located `frontend/` and the app
  icon via a path relative to the source file's own position, which assumes
  a `src/` layer a PyInstaller bundle doesn't have: both now branch on
  `sys.frozen` and resolve against the bundle's own extraction root instead.
  Notes now default to `%APPDATA%\MemoryMap AI` (or the platform
  equivalent) only for a frozen build; a source checkout is unaffected.

### Added: system tray, update check

- **System tray for the desktop window.** Closing the window now minimizes it
  to a tray icon instead of quitting; the tray menu is Open / View Logs /
  Restart / Quit. `pystray` + `Pillow` join `pywebview` as the `desktop`
  extra (`core/extras.py`) and are bundled into the Windows installer. Missing
  or unusable on the running platform (no display, package not installed) is
  a soft fallback, not a crash, the window just closes for real, same as
  before.
- **"Check for updates" (Settings → About).** Off by default, same reasoning
  as web search. A `GET /update/check` endpoint compares the running version
  against GitHub's latest release tag; the checkbox, a "Check now" button,
  and a silent startup check (toasts only when a newer version genuinely
  exists) are all new. Caught live rather than merely reasoned about: the new
  `update_check_enabled` preference wasn't declared on `PreferencesBody`, so
  the PUT silently dropped it, and `get_preferences()`'s hand-built response
  dict never echoed it back either, both fixed.

### Fixed / Added: CodeQL cleanup, extract-notes feature, a real private-note leak, design pass

- **Security.** All 81 open CodeQL alerts closed. Separately: a private
  note's ciphertext was reaching the AI in four places once a link, card, or
  reminder referencing it predated the note being marked private
  (`set_private` doesn't touch existing references), the weekly digest,
  `audit_vague_links`, the whiteboard `read_whiteboard`/`search_whiteboard`
  agent tools, and a reminder's entry preview. All four now respect the
  private-note guard; each has a regression test.
- **Extract notes** (new). Turn selected text: in the Writing Room, a
  Document, or a whiteboard multi-selection, into one or more AI-drafted
  notes, auto-filed and auto-linked with real generated reasons, previewed
  before anything is written. Reuses the janitor's filing/merge judgement
  and the librarian's link-reason generation rather than new logic.
- **Design.** An elevation (`--shadow-sm/md/lg`) and motion
  (`--motion-fast/base/slow`) token scale, replacing a dozen hand-written
  `box-shadow` values and ten distinct transition durations app-wide. A
  live mic-level meter on the dictation buttons, driven by `AnalyserNode`
  off the same stream the recorder already opens. Library/Timeline empty
  states brought in line with the rest of the app; a Library card no longer
  duplicated a titled note's title into its own preview line.
- **Perf.** Two O(n) full-table-scan-shaped bugs fixed: the reevaluate
  endpoint's linked-entry lookup now queries ids instead of loading and
  decrypting every note, and the whiteboard no longer re-parses every
  sketch's JSON on every drag frame.
- **Docs.** ~1,000 lines of resolved ROADMAP/BACKLOG items moved into
  `docs/roadmap/HISTORY.md`; both live docs now hold only open work.

### Fixed / Added: work-recovery session: icon system, spaces, timeline, chat dock, link reasons

A previous session's work was lost; the recovery attempt had left the app
with a broken icon system and several silently-dead features. Baseline was
16 failing tests, not 2, six of them because the link-reason feature had
never run once (`provider.run_prompt` does not exist).

- **Icons.** The Phosphor stylesheet was vendored but never linked, no icon
  in the app rendered. All 367 colour emoji replaced app-wide (frontend and
  backend tool/skill labels) with Phosphor glyphs via a `ph:name` label
  marker (`setLabel()`) for the ~300 that live in JS string literals rather
  than markup. `lucide.min.js` and its dead branch removed.
- **CSS correctness.** Five custom properties used but never declared
  (`--surface-2`, `--text-main`, `--card-hover`, `--radius-3`,
  `--accent-alpha-1`), an undeclared property invalidates its whole
  declaration, so the workspace menu had no background and timeline cards no
  radius. A literal `\n` inside a `:root[data-glass="off"]` selector list
  invalidated that entire rule.
- **Spaces.** Rebuilt switcher (markup had been deleted by a bad regex, CSS
  and JS left behind); create/rename/delete hardened: reserved ids can no
  longer be claimed, icon values are validated (were interpolated unescaped
  into a class name), delete reassigns every `WorkspaceMixin` model instead
  of four hardcoded ones and no longer reads a deleted ORM row.
- **Timeline grid.** Cards rebuilt with a header (when, and why), a title
  (the note's first line) and a clamped preview measured by scrollHeight,
  not a CSS clamp that does not engage in the real engine. Column banding
  and a full-height sticky band label. Grid build was O(bands × buckets ×
  notes); now one pass per band into a Map.
- **Chat dock.** Skills folded into one dropdown (selector, Auto|Manual
  pace, Run) instead of four loose controls. Plan is a toggle applied on
  the way out of `sendChatMessage`, so Enter and suggestion chips honour it
  too: previously only its own button sent a plan.
- **Link reasons.** `audit_vague_links` rewritten onto
  `librarian.generate_link_reason` (the old call target did not exist);
  rejects reasons that are themselves vague; commits once per batch instead
  of once per link; retry-limited. `_deduce_reason` no longer makes a
  blocking model call inside the link-creation request path. The backfill
  endpoint now runs the AI pass after the embedding pass, so "Give links a
  reason" writes an actual reason instead of the literal string "similar in
  meaning" for every link. Each suggestion row gets its own editable reason
  field. Background audit confirmed reached from `_run_optimization` with a
  dedicated `auto_link_reason_audit` preference (was previously untested
  that the pass reached the audit at all).
- **Security.** `_unlink_notes` bypassed the private-note guard that
  `link_notes` immediately above it enforces, it could unlink and reveal
  the existence of a private note the caller cannot read.
- **Dashboard.** Widget preview rows: `safeMdSlice` returned the empty
  string whenever an unpaired markdown marker was the first character
  (`cut.slice(0, cut.lastIndexOf(marker))` with index 0), rendering as a
  bare "…", now falls back to a plain-text slice. Block markdown (headings,
  lists) rendered as literal syntax because the widgets used the inline-only
  renderer; now strip block syntax and show the note's first line as a
  title. A widget-picker modal (roadmap item 26) on top of the existing
  `dashboard_layout` preference and inline edit mode, not a second store.
- **Graph.** Fit-to-view computed its bounding box from node centres
  (ignoring radius/halo/label), used a flat 60px margin regardless of
  container size, and clamped only the zoom-in direction, one distant
  outlier collapsed the whole graph to a scale of 0.07. Padded by rendered
  node extent, container-relative margin, clamped both directions.
- **Whiteboard.** A note card showed 100 characters of escaped plain text
  with no way to see the rest. Now full note, real markdown, clamped past a
  height cap with a Show more/less control matching the notes list.
- **Documents.** Full-height sticky sidebar (was shrink-wrapped to its
  content by a duplicate `#doc-sidebar` rule later in the file that re-set
  `align-self: start`). The storage-path disclosure moved into a dialog
  behind a link-styled button, ~370px back to the document list.
- **Sidebars.** Categories, Chats and Recent headers now sit level with
  their collapse toggle: the toggle is positioned against the card's
  border box, the heading row started at the content box, `--space-6`
  lower, with nothing keeping the two in step.
- **Misc.** `!err?.name === "AbortError"` parsed as `(!err?.name) ===
  "AbortError"`, always false, so no network failure was ever logged to
  Settings → Logs. The Capture textarea reported `scrollHeight: 0` while its
  tab was hidden and sized itself to nothing, only correcting on focus. The
  theme toggle showed a fixed half-circle in both modes; now shows the mode
  you will get (sun for light, moon for dark). Vault key rotation, added
  all-or-nothing with a test proving an interrupted rotation leaves every
  note readable under the old key. Launchers give every network call an
  explicit timeout and tell a network failure apart from a real one, so no
  internet degrades to a one-line message instead of a hang. Library image
  rename (was entirely missing) and a title-regeneration notification (was
  silently dropped by the mute filter, since it is the result of a button
  the user just pressed, not background chatter).


### Fixed / Added: whiteboard redo & select, highlighter persistence, arc-label spacing, touch input (roadmap §11, §15)

- Whiteboard: a redo stack (Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z, toolbar button), and a
  real single-item Select tool (was folded into Pan) with Delete/Backspace
  and Escape support.
- Whiteboard: a highlighter stroke's width/opacity is now saved and
  restored correctly: it previously reloaded as a plain full-opacity 3px
  line, losing the tool's whole point.
- Whiteboard: an arrow tool (shaft + arrowhead as one path/one undo entry).
  **Its live drag-to-save path was not confirmed working this session**,
  see HANDOVER.md for why, and check this first next session.
- Graph (arc view): labels were re-reported as reading like they belonged
  to the wrong node, widened node spacing, shortened the label limit, and
  steepened the label tilt so a label's own reach stays under one node-step.
  Category labels also now get an accent colour, not just bold, so they
  read as a distinct kind of label.
- Whiteboard and graph: switched from mouse events to pointer events (the
  sketch pad already did this) so touch and pen input work, not just a
  mouse: not verified against real touch hardware, reasoned from the
  event model.

### Changed: licence: MIT → AGPL-3.0

MemoryMap is now under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**. The
licence text is the official one from the FSF, unmodified.

What it means in practice:

- Anyone may use, study, modify and share it.
- Anything built on it must be released under the AGPL too, with source.
- **§13, the clause that makes it AGPL rather than GPL:** if someone modifies
  MemoryMap and lets other people use it *over a network*, they must offer
  those users the modified source. Plain GPL would not require that, because
  running a service is not distribution. For an app whose premise is "your
  notebook, on your machine", this is the licence saying what the product
  already says.

**One consequence worth flagging, because it inverts a documented constraint:**
ANALYSIS.md §34a said "odysseus is AGPL, MemoryMap is MIT, no code crosses in
either direction." Half of that is now lifted, odysseus's AGPL code *may* come
in, carrying its notices and attribution, and the other half is tighter:
nothing from here can go out to an MIT project. §34a is rewritten to say so.

Updated: `LICENSE`, the pyproject classifier, the README badge and footer,
ANALYSIS.md §34a, and the cross-reference line in every roadmap file and
CLAUDE.md.


### Fixed: the owner's reported list

Diagnosed in the running app rather than from the report. Full triage, with
what was checked and found already correct, in [ROADMAP.md §41](docs/ROADMAP.md).

- **Trace on the graph is rebuilt.** Reported as "annoying and pretty much
  unusable". `traceModeActive` was set and consulted nowhere, so the map never
  responded to a click and both ends had to be picked from `<select>` elements
  listing every note in the notebook by its opening words. Two clicks on the
  map now, with a readout instead of a form: Swap for the other direction,
  Undo for one step back rather than a reset, Escape to leave, crosshair
  cursor so the mode looks like one.
- **The autonomous-tasks switch turned itself off.** Two controls write that
  preference and the one on the skills panel saved straight to the server
  without updating `prefsCache`, so the next `savePrefs`, which rebuilds the
  whole object from the DOM, read the other checkbox and switched it back.
- **Light/dark stopped affecting the page background** after using the colour
  scheme selector. The builder computes a page colour *for a mode* and stored
  only the current one, written inline on `<html>`, where it outranks every
  `[data-mode="dark"]` rule. Both are stored and re-picked on mode change.
- **Whiteboard:** dragging a card sent no `board_id`, so a card on a named
  board was silently moved to the global one, and a 404 left it on screen
  unsaved; the board list showed "Note 25" because it read two fields an entry
  does not have; the library panel covered its own toggle so it could not be
  closed; the selected tool had no visual indicator; the zoom controls sat
  behind the agent activity monitor.
- **Skill descriptions** were clipped to one line by `.persona-preview`'s
  `white-space: nowrap` (reported twice).
- **The documents sidebar** crushed its own document list to two rows, because
  the outline and help block below it never shrink.
- Tags / Recycle bin / Activity removed from the notes sidebar, as asked.

### Added

- **A text box in "What it remembers".** `save_user_preference` is the model's
  way in; this is the one people reach for first.

### Checked and found correct, not changed

- **Password, token and secret storage.** bcrypt with a per-password salt;
  `secrets.token_hex(32)` session tokens held in memory and swept on expiry;
  private notes encrypted with a key wrapped by a password-derived key.
- The three sketch swatches reported as identical are three distinct colours.
  The real defect underneath is the highlighter at 5% opacity.


### Audited: a week of another agent's work, brought to a mergeable state

`fix/Antigravity-Audit` arrived with 8 commits, ~9,600 insertions and no test
files. It had **90 failing tests and 20 ruff errors** against a `main` whose
only two failures were a self-inflicted time bomb in a dated test. Everything
below is that audit. Full reasoning in [ROADMAP.md §40](docs/ROADMAP.md); the
three new features it brought are documented in §39.

#### Reverted

- **`POST /chat/stream` is NDJSON over a plain POST again**, not a WebSocket.
  The rewrite shared the request's SQLAlchemy Session with a producer thread
  (Sessions are not thread-safe) and closed it twice, leaked that thread when a
  client hung up, had to be mounted outside `dependencies=locked` and reimplement
  auth by hand, and replaced a transport the same-origin policy protects with
  one it does not, so any page the user had open could drive the agent. It
  also accounted for ~70 of the 90 failures. Two genuine improvements from the
  rewrite were kept: mid-stream `error` events, and tool-error logging.
- **`generate_skill` removed.** It wrote unvalidated AI-authored skills straight
  into preferences, bypassing `save_skill`'s schema check, built-in-name guard,
  tool-name validation and `MAX_SKILLS`, and called `config.save_preference`,
  a method with no definition anywhere, so it could only ever have raised.

#### Fixed: security and privacy

- **The AI could tag and link private notes.** `tag_note` and `link_notes` grew
  batch arguments and stopped routing through `_require_note`, the one place
  that refuses a private note. The batch feature is kept; the guard is back.
- **`/media/upload` and `/media/{filename}`** noted as a hardening item, the
  filename is whitelisted so there is no traversal, but uploads are served
  same-origin with no type restriction.

#### Fixed: data loss and correctness

- **JSON export silently dropped `is_deleted`**, so every note in the recycle
  bin would have re-imported as a live note.
- **Semantic search returned nothing after an embedding-model change.** Every
  stored vector was stacked into one array; a notebook holding two widths
  mid-reindex raised on the ragged list and took every query down with it. The
  same crash, plus an N×N memory blowup, was in the graph's similarity edges
  and in link suggestions, all three now go through one blocked,
  dimension-safe `embeddings.similar_pairs`.
- **`?semantic=true` threw away its own ranking**, returning matches in
  notebook order, and swallowed a cold embedding model as "here is your whole
  notebook" instead of a 503.
- **Notes sharing an uppercase tag stopped being neighbours**, the tag index
  was keyed lowercase and intersected against unfolded tags.
- **`search_notes` scaled its ceiling with the context window**, so a 128k
  model could pull 768 note previews into a single tool result.
- **`find_similar_notes` was listed in `WRITE_TOOLS`**, so a pure read cleared
  the agent's read-dedup ledger and counted as work for the claim checker.
- **`ask_user` was culled from small models**, leaving them to guess, the
  exact failure that tool exists to prevent.
- **The memory stream was injected unbounded into the system prompt** on every
  round, past the `PROSE_BUDGET_CHARS` guard that exists to stop that. Now
  capped at 600 characters, newest-first, and never fatal when unavailable.

#### Fixed: features that had never executed once

- **The background librarian was never started.** `app.py` imported
  `autonomous` and called nothing, so the interval, the on/off switch and three
  task toggles in Settings were wired to a loop that did not run.
- **`clean_orphaned_vectors` did not exist.** The call sat inside an
  `except Exception` wide enough to swallow the `AttributeError`. Now
  implemented, and it returns a count.
- **`VACUUM` moved onto an autocommit connection.** Through a `Session` it
  works only while it is the first statement, pysqlite defers its BEGIN, and
  raises once anything has read or written, which is the state the background
  pass leaves behind.
- **`trigger-autonomous` had no guard**, so each press started another agent
  loop against the same notebook.
- **Thirty-five inline `style` attributes in index.html, and five more inside
  app.js template literals**, all refused by the app's own
  `style-src 'self'` CSP and therefore rendering as no styling at all.

#### Fixed: the interface

- **Every card, field and dialog in the app had no border and no shadow.**
  `border-style` and `shadow-intensity`, two new Settings controls, were
  missing from `APPEARANCE_DEFAULTS`, so `undefined` and `NaN` were written
  into two CSS custom properties on `<html>`. Both are invalid where they are
  *used*, which is an `!important` rule matching `.card`, `input`, `textarea`,
  `select`, `.modal` and `.sidebar`, and the `rgba()` inside `--glass-shadow`.
- **`.glass` erased the background of every `card glass` element** by pointing
  at `--bg-glass`, a token no theme declares. The command palette showed an
  input and a hint floating over the page with no surface behind them.
- **Thirteen further undeclared tokens** (`--card-bg`, `--text`, `--panel`,
  `--shadow-sm/md`, `--border-light`, `--sw-*`, …) across 23 dead declarations,
  now aliased to the real theme-aware tokens.
- **Graph Trace threw a ReferenceError.** It moved from two `<select>`s to
  click-two-notes and left three references to the locals the selects filled.
- **Picking a sketch colour left the eraser armed**, the button was renamed
  and one call kept the old id, swallowed by an optional chain.
- **Tags / Recycle bin / Activity** lost their markup but kept their click
  handlers; the sidebar shortcuts are back.
- `applyThemeChoice(undefined)` stamped `data-theme="undefined"` onto `<html>`.

#### Added: tests and lints

46 tests across `test_whiteboard.py`, `test_autonomous.py` and
`test_antigravity_regressions.py`; 28 of the 32 applicable ones fail against
the original branch. Four lints, each closing a gap where nothing was looking:
every appearance setting has a default; no token is used undeclared without a
fallback; the inline-style ban covers app.js; and the dated search tests own
their own clock.


### Fixed: agent robustness pass

- **A skill/plan step now hands the next step the actual notes and
  documents it touched, not just its own prose summary.** Reported as the
  agent "losing the plot half way through a job": a step's own narration
  ("tagged the relevant notes") was all the next step ever saw, so a later
  step needing "those notes" had nothing to act on but a sentence.
  `skill_runner._step_answer` now appends the real ids from the step's own
  `change` events.
- **A skill step that created a document could produce a change whose
  `note_id` was actually that document's id.** `agent.py` read every
  write tool's result `"id"` field and called it a note id unconditionally;
  `create_document`'s `"id"` is a document's. The chat UI's existing View
  button (§21/§22) would then navigate to the wrong note, or nowhere.
  `agent._change_note_id`/`_change_document_id` now resolve each tool's id
  from the field it actually uses.

### Added: §37G, §37I, §37K

- **A document importer.** `markitdown` had been an installable extra with
  nothing calling it since it was added; Settings → Import & export now has
  an "Import a document" button (PDF, Word, slides) alongside the existing
  markdown importer. A converted file with more than one top-level heading
  becomes one note per heading, a deck or a document with real chapters,
  otherwise the whole thing is one note, capped at 25 notes per upload.
- **The sketch pad accepts a background image.** An "🖼️ Add image" button
  draws a chosen photo onto its own canvas layer beneath the pen strokes, so
  drawing over a screenshot or a photo works the way annotating one would be
  expected to. The Eraser now clears pixels to transparent rather than
  painting white, so erasing a stroke reveals the image underneath instead of
  punching a white hole through it.
- **`compress_chat`, an agent tool.** The agent can now ask to compress the
  older part of a long conversation, `POST /chat/compress`'s summarising
  logic, reused rather than duplicated, but the turn still ends on a review
  card the user approves before it replaces anything, the same human-gated
  flow the manual Compress button already used. Deciding *not* to let the
  agent auto-apply its own summary was the point: a summary nobody can
  correct is one they have to trust blindly.
- **A handful of emoji were missing their colour variation selector**
  (⚡️ ✖️ ▶️ ☑️ ⚠️), rendering as thin text-style glyphs on some platforms next
  to fully-qualified emoji in the same row, the same bug one of them was
  already fixed for once, audited across the rest of the frontend.

### Fixed: a second round of reported UI bugs

- **Quick sketch's Close button darkened the background instead of closing.**
  `#sketch-overlay` sat at `z-index: 60`, the toast/popup tier; the "close
  without saving?" confirm dialog is a `.modal-overlay` at `z-index: 55` and
  painted behind it. Lowered to 55, matching every other modal.
  `#improve-overlay` had the identical latent bug and is fixed alongside it.
- **Dropdown arrows clashed with option text app-wide.** The shared
  `input`/`select` rule gave equal padding on both sides, with nothing
  reserved for the browser's own arrow. Every `<select>` now gets a painted
  chevron in reserved padding, not just the chat dock's.
- **The notes-list toolbar's controls were four different heights.** Same fix
  as the Library toolbar: one declared `--control-h` for the filter box, the
  sort select and both buttons.
- **The category sidebar's ✎/🗑 buttons overlapped the note count** instead of
  replacing it: `background: inherit` was meant to hide the count underneath
  but a glass card is never fully opaque. The count now fades out exactly
  when the actions fade in.
- **A stale login token produced a toast storm before the lock screen.**
  Every parallel bootstrap request hitting the same 401 toasted its own
  "Couldn't load X: Locked" on top of the lock screen that had already,
  correctly, explained the one real state. The 401 now carries a marker the
  bootstrap loop checks before toasting.
- **First load now defaults to the Dashboard**, not Notes. Only the fallback
  changed: a returning visit still opens on whichever tab was last active.

### Roadmap

- §37 triages a longer list of reported work (chat dock density, a
  resizable/refined web panel, a UI zoom setting, the graph toolbar, sketch
  image/document upload, llama.cpp wiring, chat compression as an agent tool,
  a real Timeline fix, emoji rendering) in priority order, and corrects three
  stale claims in the roadmap's own top-level priority sections, including
  "the Library tab" listed as an open Tier 3 item after it had been built and
  partly deleted.

### Removed: the three panels the Library replaced (roadmap §36G)

**The first surface this project has taken away rather than added.** The Notes
sidebar's 🗑, 📜 and 🏷 buttons opened the Library, but `#bin-panel`,
`#activity-panel` and `#tags-panel` were still in the markup and still
rendered, so each of those three things had two implementations, and the
bin's two could disagree about what was in it, because each fetched its own
list. Gone with them: `renderBin`, `renderActivity`, `renderTags`, `showPanel`,
the `#bin-empty` handler and `entryItem`'s `options.bin` branch.

- **Reading a binned note in full** is what had to exist first, and is the only
  reason the bin panel had outlived its chip: a Library card shows a preview,
  which is the wrong thing to decide "restore or delete for good?" from. A
  Library card now opens a read-only reader with the note's own markdown,
  Restore, and Delete for good.
- `GET /entries/{id}?deleted=true` reaches into the bin when the caller asks.
  An ordinary read still 404s on a binned note, and reading one does **not**
  count towards "most accessed".
- "Kept for N days" moved to the Library's bin bar. It was the one thing the
  panel said that the Library did not.

### Added

- **Embedding models you can see and remove** (Settings → Optional extras).
  Which models are on this machine, their real size on disk, where the cache
  is, and download / re-download / remove. Answers a question the logs made
  look alarming: the model is fetched **once**, the HuggingFace requests on
  every start are checking the copy you already have.
- **A 🧭 Plan button in the chat.** The `make_plan` tool has existed since
  §35K and the only way to reach it was to hope the model chose it. An action
  rather than a toggle: planning costs a round-trip, and "plan this one" is a
  decision about the message in the box.
- **SearXNG can start with the app** (Settings → Web search, off by default).
  Reported as web search "disabling itself", it was the container going away
  after a reboot, and every search after that fell through to a rate-limited
  DuckDuckGo.
- **The dashboard's launcher is three labelled groups**, Start something, Jump
  to, Run a skill, instead of one grid of seven identical chips doing three
  different jobs. The Library, the Timeline and the command palette are
  reachable from it at last.
- **Optional extras that nothing calls yet are greyed out** and refused
  server-side, with the reason on the card. `markitdown` and
  `llama-cpp-python` install a library the app never imports.

### Changed

- **Web search opens as a column beside the conversation**, not a drawer inside
  the composer dock. Inside the dock it had to be capped at `min(38vh, 20rem)`
  - a search box, a results list and a whole web page in 20rem, reported as
  *"squashed ugly … what it is right now isn't working"*. As a column it needs
  no cap at all, and the reader takes the column over rather than sharing it.
- **The dock's controls are one visual family**: one corner radius, one border,
  one hover, and selects that give up the platform's chrome. A toggle that is
  on now says so with the accent.
- **Switches instead of checkboxes** wherever a checkbox means on-or-off.
  Radios keep `accent-color`, one-of-several is not on-or-off, and
  checkboxes in a *list* stay ticks.
- The **Rediscover** widget renders markdown instead of showing `## Schedule`
  and `**bold**` spelled out.
- The **logs screen** fills its pane instead of stopping at 46vh.

### Fixed

- **The chat dock drew outside its own card.** Measured at 1849×700 with a
  hand-dragged composer: the dock's box ended at y=614 and the composer at
  y=814, with Send below the window. A dragged height is now trimmed to the
  room the card has, measured, not guessed, and the *preference* is never
  rewritten, so the box comes back when there is room.
- **Starting a skill from the dashboard didn't take you to it.** The run began
  and streamed into a tab nobody was looking at.
- **Every sticky sidebar was 22px too tall.** Three rules wrote the same
  `calc` by hand and all three left out the page's bottom padding, so each
  sidebar ended that far under the status bar. Reported twice in one day, for
  two different sidebars, because it was never one sidebar's bug.
- **The graph drew outside its card** when the legend wrapped: a `22rem` floor
  under the map plus a legend as tall as the notebook has categories is more
  than a short window has.
- **The settings search box** was drawn under the nav's scrollbar.
- A second `py/polynomial-redos` in `search/query.py` (CodeQL, high). A
  character class with `*` next to an anchor is the shape to avoid; the linear
  replacement is again the more readable one.

### Fixed: long jobs finish, or say where they stopped (roadmap §35K)

Two reports, one subject: *"the agent struggles with long tasks like skills
then cuts out half way through and has to restart, or it hits a limit for tool
calls which has happened quite a bit."*

- **Rounds are earned now, not granted.** The cap counted rounds, which cannot
  tell a model doing eight useful things from a model doing the same thing
  eight times: and "tag these eight notes" is a search, a read and eight
  writes. A round that makes a successful call it has not already made buys
  another round, up to a ceiling. A model looping on one call earns nothing and
  still stops where it always did.
- **A step that ran out of rounds is no longer ticked off as done.** The runner
  could only see that the step's turn produced text, and "I couldn't finish
  step 1" is text: so a step cut off mid-job was marked ✓ and the next one ran
  on top of half-finished work. It is marked stalled, the run stops there, and
  the result says which step it stopped on.
- **Resume from step N.** A run that stopped picks up where it stopped instead
  of being restarted over notes it has already changed. A turn that ran out of
  rounds gets a **Continue** button, rather than a paragraph asking you to type
  "carry on".

### Added: the agent can plan a big job and work through it (roadmap §35K)

Reported: *"I will say fix my categories and it will only merge two categories
and leave it at that, ignoring the rest."*

A model given one broad instruction does the first part and reports success.
Skills already solved this, each step is its own turn, but only for a job you
had saved as a skill. Now the agent can call **`make_plan`**: it writes 2–6
steps, its turn ends, and the same runner works through them one at a time,
ticking each off and listing what changed with an Undo on each.

A plan is a skill nobody saved, so it looks and behaves exactly like a skill
run. A plan that is too long is refused rather than trimmed, because silently
dropping the end of the job is the failure this exists to prevent.

### Changed: the chat controls moved down to the chat box (roadmap §36B)

Asked for directly: *"moving the majority of the ui controls like the
chat/agent pull, web search and stuff to the bottom bar with the chat input."*

Chat/Agent, Web, answer length, persona, the skill picker and attached notes
now sit in a dock with the message box, so you set them as you write instead of
scrolling back to the top of a long conversation. The chat header keeps what is
about the conversation itself, its name, what it has cost, and Export. The web
and persona panels moved down with the buttons that open them.

### Added: compress a long conversation (roadmap §35I)

Asked for directly: *"there should be a tool as well as a manual command or
something to be able to compress chat context on longer chats so the AI can
better continue."*

**🗜 Compress** in the chat header summarises the earlier messages, shows you
the summary to read and edit, and then sends that in place of them. What it
fixes is not what it sounds like: a long chat never overflowed the model's
window, the oldest messages were quietly dropped to make room, so the model
was forgetting the start of the conversation and re-asking things you had told
it. A summary keeps the gist of ten messages for the price of one.

Nothing is deleted. Every message stays in the conversation and in the saved
transcript; only what the model is *sent* changes, and one Undo puts it back.

### Changed: the chat's controls are one strip, and its header has two levels

The dock under the chat was three stacked bands, skills, controls, then the
message box: which is most of the height of a short conversation. It is one
line now: skills · what the AI may use · how it answers, with everything the
same height so it reads as a single strip. The skill's description moved into
the picker's tooltip, where the steps and tools it uses already were.

The chat header shows the conversation's name as a heading with its token count
and compression state as quiet metadata beneath, instead of a row of things
that all looked like buttons.

### Fixed: the desktop app could keep running an old build

If a button you were told was fixed is still broken, this is why. The frontend
was served with no `Cache-Control` header at all, which lets a cache reuse it
without checking: and the desktop shell has no reload button, its own on-disk
cache, and restarts the process without clearing it. After an update it could
go on running the previous `app.js` indefinitely. The files are now served
`no-cache`, so every start checks for a newer build (and gets a 304 when there
isn't one).

The recycle bin's **Empty now** was the report that led here. It was driven end
to end in a real browser against this server: the confirm dialog opens, the
notes go, the bin comes back empty. The fix has been in the code since §35F,
what was missing was any guarantee you were running it.

### Fixed: reminders were polled twice a minute, not once

A rewrite left the previous poller's timer behind. Both timers ran the new
poller, so the app asked the server for reminders twice as often as intended,
and two polls landing together could announce the same reminder twice.

### Fixed: all seven tabs stay readable

When the tab strip cannot fit beside the app name and the header buttons it now
takes a row of its own, instead of scrolling with "Dashboard" clipped against
the left edge.

### Fixed: the Reminders tab is no longer faded at the edge

Reported: *"the reminders tab in the top bar is partially faded out on the
right."* The tab strip's fade meant "this bar scrolls" rather than "there is
more that way", so the last tab stayed dimmed with nothing hidden behind it.
Each edge now fades only when there is something beyond it, the fade is a fixed
width rather than a share of the bar, and choosing a tab scrolls it into view.

### Added: any OpenAI-compatible backend (roadmap §6)

The headline ask was "support LM Studio". What got built is the **dialect**,
not the product: LM Studio serves the OpenAI API on `localhost:1234/v1`, and so
do llama.cpp's server, Jan, vLLM, and Ollama's own `/v1` surface. One provider
gets all of them, and the only thing that differs between them is an address.

Pick it in **Settings → Models → Model backend**. It applies immediately: no
restart, nothing to put in `.env`, and the setting is saved whether or not the
server is answering yet, because "set the address, then start the server" is
the normal order to do it in.

- **`ai/provider.py` is the new seam.** Everything that was never actually
  about Ollama moved there and is now shared: the think-tag splitter, the
  tool-text gate and the prose-tool-call recovery, the error classes, the
  context ceiling, the neutral `{context_tokens, max_output_tokens}` budget.
  They were *moved*, not copied, a test asserts they are gone from the old
  file, because two copies of a tool-call gate that drift apart is exactly the
  bug this refactor exists to prevent.

- **`OllamaError` is still the error every route catches**, because it is now
  an alias for the neutral `ProviderError` rather than a sibling of it. A new
  parent class would have read as tidier and quietly stopped a dozen existing
  `except OllamaError` handlers firing for the second provider.

- **Streamed tool calls arrive in fragments keyed by an index**, which has no
  Ollama equivalent: arguments come through as partial JSON spread over many
  chunks, and two concurrent calls interleave on the wire. Folding them by
  arrival order instead of by index produces one unparseable blob the moment a
  model asks for two things at once, which small models do constantly.

- **The window a server *loaded* beats the window a model *could* hold.** LM
  Studio reports both; a 128k model loaded at 4k will drop the front of the
  prompt, the system prompt, the part telling it that it has tools, if the
  app budgets against the bigger number. Where nothing is reported at all
  (plain llama.cpp), a known-model table answers, and where that doesn't
  either, the app says "unknown" and budgets conservatively rather than
  inventing a number nobody verified.

- **Tool results are addressed by id.** Ollama accepts `{"role": "tool",
  "tool_name": …}`; the OpenAI shape wants a `tool_call_id` matching an id the
  assistant turn issued. The agent keeps writing one dialect and the client
  translates at the boundary, including the case where a model calls the same
  tool twice in one turn, where matching on name alone leaves a call
  unanswered and the server rejects the whole turn.

- **The trap §6 named, closed.** `tests/test_context_budget.py` asserts all
  four Ollama generation paths send an options block; `tests/test_providers.py`
  now asserts the equivalent for the new provider, against the payloads that
  actually went out. A path that omits `max_tokens` is a model running unbounded
  on the backend's defaults: the bug the context-budget work was spent fixing,
  arriving again through a different door.

- Downloading models is an Ollama capability, so the suggested-downloads panel
  hides itself on the other backends rather than offering a button that cannot
  work, and the status line names whichever backend actually answered instead
  of telling an LM Studio user to go and install Ollama.

### Added: finished background tasks, and a way to quit

**Settings → Background tasks now shows what stopped, not only what is
running.** The old rule was that a finished job isn't a task and a screen that
accumulates them is a log, tidy, and wrong in the one way that matters: a job
that *fails* disappeared at the moment it became interesting. A re-index that
died halfway left exactly the same empty list as one that finished, and the
reason existed only in the log console, a different screen you have to know to
open. Endings are now recorded with their outcome and reason: in memory,
bounded to the last 40, newest first. Cancelling is reported as *cancelled*
rather than failed: a user's own decision in red is how people learn to ignore
red.

**A Quit button** stops the app and its server properly. Until now the ways out
were Ctrl+C in a window the launcher hides, or closing the tab and leaving the
server running: which is why a second start could find its port taken. It is a
POST behind the unlock gate (a GET would be reachable from a link in another
tab), it replies before it signals, and it uses SIGINT rather than a hard exit
so uvicorn's normal shutdown runs and the SearXNG subprocess is torn down by
the code that knows how.

### Changed: many more suggested models, sorted by what your machine can run

Three chat models became twelve, in three tiers, runs-on-anything, 8 GB, and
a mixture-of-experts tier for 16 GB and up, in Settings → Models and in the
README, on the current Gemma 4 and Qwen 3.5 families.

The MoE tier is the one worth explaining rather than just listing:
`gemma4:26b-a4b` holds 26B of weights but computes with 4B of them at a time,
so it downloads like a big model and answers at roughly the speed of a small
one. Judged on download size alone nobody with 16 GB would try it, and it is
the best answer for that machine.

**Sorted smallest-first rather than best-first**, which is the ordering that
matters: someone reading the list is choosing against hardware they already
own, and a quality-sorted list puts the model they can't run at the top and the
one they should start with out of sight. Each says what it is *for* rather than
how good it is, and the README points at the new "Can use tools" row for agent
work: read from the model rather than guessed.

### Added: five notebook-audit skills, and taking a link back out

Asked for: *"a skill that can do a full audit and clean up of my notebook,
linking notes, removing inaccurate links, analysing categories and tags,
retagging, changing categories, moving notes, combining duplicates."*

Built as **five skills rather than one**, and not for tidiness: a skill runs one
step per turn and holds at most ten steps, so a single "audit everything" skill
would either stop half-finished or have steps so broad a 3B model can't tell
whether it has done them. Each job also wants a different toolbox, and the
allowlist is what keeps a run cheap and safe.

- **🩺 Notebook health check**: the audit. Read-only *by construction*: it is
  offered no tool that can write, so a model that ignores "change nothing"
  still can't. Finishes by naming which clean-up skill fixes each problem.
- **🏷 Clean up my tags**, merges plurals, spellings and synonyms via
  `rename_tag`, then removes tags that don't match what a note says.
- **🗂 Reorganise my categories**: proposes a structure first, then creates,
  renames, merges and moves notes into it. `delete_category` is deliberately
  absent: it's destructive, so it would stop a bulk run for a confirm card, and
  merging keeps the notes together rather than scattering them.
- **🔗 Fix my links**: removes connections that don't hold up and adds ones
  that should exist.
- **🧬 Find notes worth combining**, reports the merged note it *would* write
  and links the group. Deciding what to lose isn't a judgement to hand a model
  across a whole notebook.

**`unlink_notes`** is the tool that made the fourth possible. Its absence had a
specific cost: an audit could add a connection and never correct one, so a wrong
link was permanent from inside the app. It is a write but *not* destructive,
no writing is lost, both notes survive, and the result carries the `link_notes`
call that puts it back, because a confirm card on every correction in a tidy-up
run is how people learn to click through confirm cards. (Removing a link by hand
already worked: the `×` on a link chip in Notes.)

### Changed: the graph tool costs half what it did

Asked for: *"the knowledge graph needs to be very solid and token efficient."*
It wasn't. Twelve neighbours came back as full `_note_summary` rows: 200-char
previews, ISO timestamps, `pinned`, `truncated`, and a null `via` on every
one-hop result: **~1,230 tokens for one call**, a third of a 4k window before
the question or the notes.

A graph walk's job is to say *what connects to what*; reading one in full is
`get_note`'s job. Rows now carry an id, a 90-character preview, the category,
how it connects and how far, with tags and `via` omitted when empty rather than
sent as null. **633 tokens**, and a test holds the worst case under 800.

### Changed: skills the model can find, and a budget guard retired

A skill was findable only by the person who remembered writing it. `when_to_use`
is a field now, *when* to reach for a skill, as opposed to what it is, and
`list_skills` reports it along with `step_count` and `changes_notes`, so a skill
that alters the notebook reads differently from one that only summarises. The
note to the model also says plainly that it cannot start a skill itself, because
a model that believes it can will narrate having done so.

**`PROMPT_BUDGET_CHARS` is retired**, on its own instructions. Its comment said
to retire it if it ever needed raising a third time for a tool rather than for
prose: and the third time came in the same session, for one added argument on
`save_skill`. It weighed the *whole* tool registry, and no turn has sent the
whole registry since `within_budget` started fitting the schemas to the model's
reported window. A guard that must be raised every time the app legitimately
grows is not a guard; it is a chore that teaches people to edit the number.

Two assertions replace it, each measuring something real: `PROSE_BUDGET_CHARS`
covers the persona and TOOLS_GUIDE, which nothing trims and which are sent
whole to a 3B model and a 70B one alike; and the existing post-trim test covers
what actually reaches a 4,096-token model. The registry is capped by the
model's real window, per turn, by code that is tested.

### Added: the graph is walkable by the AI (roadmap §9)

Asked directly: *"is the graph an actual knowledge graph? I want it to be one
for the AI to have easily usable and accessible context."*

It was half of one. The edges were real and persisted, explicit links, reply
threads, shared tags: and the graph *view* has drawn them as typed edges since
it was built. What the agent could see was `get_note`'s `links` field: a bare
list of note ids, with no indication of what any of them meant, one note per
tool call. It could add connections and never follow them.

`related_notes` walks the neighbourhood breadth-first to depth 2, capped at 12
notes, and **every result says how it connects**, "linked", "thread: this is a
reply to it", "shares #recipes", plus how many hops out and which note it hung
off. The typing is the point: "you linked these" and "these share a tag" are
different strengths of evidence, and a flat list of ids hides that. Sharing a
*category* is deliberately not a connection, since nearly every note shares one.

**Potential connections too**, on request: `include_suggestions` adds notes that
*read* alike but were never linked. They come back in their own list, labelled
"NOT linked yet", with an instruction to say so, because the one way this could
mislead is a guess repeated to the user as a fact. Off by default, since a
similarity sweep costs a comparison per note.

### Security: the AI is locked to this machine by default

The backend address is now *refused* if it isn't on this computer or your own
network, rather than allowed with a warning. "100% offline, on your machine"
should be a promise the app keeps, not one it reminds you that you are breaking.

Enforced in two places, and the second is the one that matters:
`preferences.json` is a plain file, and it is what a restored backup or a copied
config brings with it, so checking only at the endpoint would let an address
that never passed through it be used anyway, silently, on every turn. When the
saved address is refused the app falls back to the local default and logs why,
rather than refusing to start: it has to open so the setting can be fixed from
inside it.

Unlocking is a visible switch in Settings → Models, for anyone who genuinely
wants a hosted API.

### Fixed: "'timeout' is not recognized" on Windows

Reported in use, and real. `start.bat` waited three seconds before opening the
browser with `timeout /t 3`, and `timeout` is `System32\timeout.exe`, an
external program, not a `cmd` builtin. On any machine whose `PATH` has lost
System32 it fails outright, and it also refuses to run when its input is
redirected. It now waits with the virtual environment's own Python, which the
script has already created and checked at an absolute path, so it needs nothing
on `PATH` at all.

### Added: peek, colour schemes, and saving a look (roadmap §33)

Three appearance additions, the first two taken from odysseus.

- **Peek.** A checkbox in the Settings title bar fades the panel so a colour
  change can be seen on the page behind it. The technique is the part worth
  copying: the fade is `color-mix` on the *background*, never element
  `opacity`, opacity fades the swatches and the controls too, which makes the
  thing you are trying to judge harder to see rather than easier. It clears
  itself on close and when you leave Appearance, because a panel left
  semi-transparent on the Logs screen reads as a rendering bug.

- **Build a scheme from one colour.** Picking an accent is easy; picking a page
  background that *goes* with it is the part people give up on. Choose a colour
  and a relationship, monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triadic, and
  the two are worked out together: the hue rotates by the amount that
  relationship names, the saturation drops hard (a background carrying the
  accent's full saturation is exhausting to read against), and the lightness
  goes to whichever end the *resolved* mode needs, so it is right under
  "System" too.

- **Save the look you built.** Everything the appearance controls write,
  colours, font, spacing, corners, background, the selected theme, saved under
  a name and applied again in one click. Stored server-side with the rest of
  your preferences rather than in the browser: a look built by hand is a thing
  you would be upset to lose to a cleared cache, and in preferences it rides
  along in the daily backup and is there in the desktop window too.

### Added: the agent can ask instead of guessing (roadmap §33)

Told "delete the one about the beans" when there are three, the agent had
exactly one move: pick one and act. A confident wrong action on someone's
notebook is worse than a question, and the user finds out afterwards.

`ask_user` offers 2-6 options as buttons and **ends the turn**, which is the
feature, not a limitation: the model asked because it does not know what to do
next, so carrying on would mean carrying on with the guess the question exists
to avoid.

- **No state is parked on the server.** The choice is sent as the user's next
  message, so the answer arrives through the ordinary history the model already
  reads. Nothing to expire, nothing lost on a reload, and the exchange saves
  into the conversation like any other.
- **A malformed question is recoverable, not fatal.** A model that offers one
  option, or sends `"yes, no"` as a string instead of a list, has made a fixable
  mistake: the string is parsed, and anything genuinely unusable goes back to
  the model with the reason so the run continues rather than stranding the user.
- **It cannot be run as an ordinary tool.** The handler raises, so a path that
  bypasses the agent loop can't fabricate an answer to a question nobody saw.
- It is offered on every turn, because a request can be ambiguous whatever it
  is about and a keyword rule has nothing to match on. That is only defensible
  while it stays cheap, so the schema is 507 characters and a test holds it
  under 900.

### Added: quick / normal / detailed (roadmap §11)

The prompt side of a turn has been budgeted against the model's real window
since the context work. The **output** side had one number for everything:
`num_predict` was a flat 1,024 whether the question was "when did I write about
beans" or "draft me a summary of the last month". Output tokens are generated
one at a time, so they cost far more wall-clock each than prompt tokens do, a
uniform cap means every short question pays for the possibility of a long
answer.

One picker in the chat toolbar now moves four settings together: the reply cap,
the temperature, the thinking toggle and a length hint in the prompt. They
belong together: capping the reply without telling the model to be brief
truncates it mid-sentence, which reads as a crash rather than as brevity.

- **`normal` is exactly what every turn got before**, and a test says so. It is
  the default, so anything else would mean upgrading silently changed
  everyone's chats.
- **Settings a model can't do are never sent.** Thinking is only ever toggled
  *off*: turning it off on a model with none is a harmless no-op, while turning
  it on where it isn't supported is the request that errors. An unset
  temperature is omitted rather than sent as null, absent means "your default",
  which is what happened before presets existed.
- **The picker is per-turn, the preference is the default.** One quick answer
  doesn't change the setting for every answer after it, but the last choice is
  remembered so someone who works in Quick isn't re-picking it every reload.
- The mode list is served from `GET /chat/modes` rather than duplicated in
  `app.js`, so adding a fourth preset is a change to `ai/presets.py` alone.

### Security: the backend address is the one setting that can leave the machine

Everything else about MemoryMap is local by construction: the server binds to
localhost, the database is a file, nothing phones home. §6 made the chat
backend an address the user types, and the server posts their notes to whatever
it names on every turn. That is a new outbound surface, and it needs the
*opposite* rule from the web reader's.

`websearch._assert_external` refuses anything that isn't public, because it
follows untrusted links and must never probe this machine. A model backend is
supposed to be on localhost or the LAN, so private addresses are the normal
case there and refusing them would break the only thing the setting is for.

- **Refused: non-http(s) schemes, link-local, multicast and unspecified
  addresses.** The one that matters is link-local: `169.254.169.254` is the
  cloud instance-metadata service and the classic credential-theft target, and
  nobody has ever served a language model from it. `::ffff:169.254.169.254` is
  the same address wearing a hat and is refused too.
- **The check order is load-bearing, and getting it wrong is a real hole.**
  Python classes `169.254.0.0/16` as link-local *and* `is_private`, so an
  allow-private rule running first waves the metadata address straight
  through; `::1` is loopback *and* `is_reserved`, so a refuse-reserved rule
  running first rejects the most ordinary backend there is. A test asserts
  both overlaps, so a well-meaning tidy-up of the order fails loudly.
- **A backend on the internet is allowed and said out loud.** Someone who
  deliberately wants a hosted API is entitled to one; what they are not
  entitled to is for it to happen quietly, because the app's headline promise
  is that notes stay on the machine. Settings → Models shows a plain warning
  naming what is being sent where, and it stays until the address changes.
- A name that does not resolve yet is not an error, "set the address, then
  start the server" is the normal order, and a container name resolves only
  once its container is up.

### Security

The roadmap's security tier, worked through end to end. Three of its seven
items turned out to be built already (SQLite WAL mode, the unlock-gate
backoff, and the scrypt KDF behind private notes); all three now have tests,
so the next audit does not have to rediscover them. The other four were real.

- **SearXNG was reachable from the local network when run under Docker.** The
  container was created with `-p 8888:8080`, which publishes on *every*
  interface rather than just this machine, and because Docker installs its
  own firewall rules, a host firewall set to refuse that port never saw the
  packet. SearXNG has no authentication in front of it, so anyone on the same
  network had both a free proxy to the internet and a view of what had been
  searched for. It is now published to `127.0.0.1` only. Port publishing is
  fixed when a container is created, so **a container left behind by an
  earlier version is detected and recreated** rather than started as it was;
  one that cannot be inspected is left alone rather than removed on a guess.
  The from-source path was never affected, it has always set
  `SEARXNG_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1`.

- **Requests caused by another site's page are refused.** Binding to localhost
  keeps the network out, but not a page open in another browser tab: it can
  have the browser send requests to `http://localhost:8000` on your behalf,
  which is how local dev servers and Ollama itself have been attacked. The API
  now checks the `Origin` (or, failing that, `Referer`) against the host the
  request was actually sent to. Requests carrying neither header still work,
  that is curl, the desktop window, and a shortcut, none of which a browser
  sends an origin for. This closes a window that was widest **before a
  password was set**, when the unlock gate is deliberately open and a
  drive-by `POST /auth/setup` could have claimed a new notebook outright.

- **Sessions expire.** Unlock tokens lived in memory until the app restarted,
  which on a notebook left open for weeks is not a limit. They now expire 12
  hours after last use, and 7 days after being issued however busy they have
  been. Expiry also forgets the private-note key, so an expired session cannot
  leave decrypted notes behind in memory.

- **Every response carries a strict Content-Security-Policy**, no inline
  script or style, no `eval`, and no remote host named anywhere in it. The
  project's existing "no asset from a CDN" rule is what made a policy this
  tight affordable. Alongside it: `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and a `Permissions-Policy`
  disabling geolocation, camera, payment and USB (but deliberately not the
  microphone, which voice capture needs).

### Added

- **The Logs screen is live.** It streams as things happen instead of showing
  whatever was there when you opened it, which is what it was asked to be:
  "like the terminal running in the background, with key errors flagged".
  Alongside that:
  - **Follow** keeps the newest records in view, and pauses the moment you
    scroll up to read something, scrolling back to the bottom resumes it.
  - **Filters** by level (all / warnings / errors), by source, and by text.
    They re-draw what is already on screen rather than refetching, so changing
    one in the middle of an incident cannot lose the records you were reading.
    When a filter hides records it says how many, because "nothing matches"
    and "nothing happened" are different answers.
  - **Tracebacks** fold open under the record they belong to.
  - **Server and browser logs are one list**, tagged by source and ordered by
    time. A browser error and the request that caused it are the same event
    seen from two ends.
  - **Errors that arrive while you are on another screen** show as a count on
    the Logs item in the settings menu.

- **The AI can manage categories, not just use them.** It could already file a
  note into a category but had no way to make one, so asking it to organise
  anything ran into a wall. It now has `create_category`, `rename_category`,
  `merge_categories` and `delete_category`, enough to answer "tidy up my
  duplicate categories" or "file these under a new Recipes category".

  Deleting a category never deletes notes; they're kept and become
  Uncategorised. Merging and deleting ask for your approval before they run,
  because neither can be undone afterwards, nothing records which notes came
  from where. Creating and renaming can be undone, and offer it.

- **Any error in the log can be copied on its own.** Each record has its own
  copy button that takes the traceback with it, and an open traceback has a
  **Copy traceback** button of its own, so getting one error out is a click,
  not a filter-then-select-across-a-scrolling-box. The error count on the Logs
  menu item is clickable and opens the screen already filtered to errors, and
  **Copy all** relabels itself to "Copy 12 shown" whenever a filter is hiding
  something, because copying less than it promised is not something you'd
  discover until you pasted it.

- **A support bundle button** (Settings → Logs). It saves a zip containing the
  log, your settings, app and model status, and how many notes exist, the
  things a bug report needs. Nothing is sent anywhere: the file lands on your
  disk and it is entirely your choice whether to share it.

  Settings are filtered by an **allowlist**, not a denylist. Diagnostic ones go
  in as they are; everything else is described rather than disclosed, so your
  display name appears as `"str, 31 chars"` and never as its value. No note,
  document, chat or reminder content is included at all. The README inside the
  zip says all of this, and suggests skimming the log before sending, since log
  messages can quote things you typed.

- **The results panel says which engine answered, and what that meant.** You
  choose an engine in Settings for a privacy reason, and until now nothing
  reported whether that choice was honoured, under *Automatic* the engine
  that answers is not necessarily the one configured. Searches now report
  "via SearXNG: your own instance, the query stayed on your machine" or
  "via DuckDuckGo: a third party saw this query, but not your notes",
  **including when nothing was found**, which is when it matters most and was
  exactly when the panel used to go quiet. Individual results also name the
  upstream engines SearXNG used to find them: it is a metasearch engine, so
  "via SearXNG" describes where the query was assembled, not who answered it.

- **The log viewer admits when it has forgotten something.** The buffer keeps
  the most recent 500 records and silently discarded the rest, so a busy hour
  and a quiet one looked identical, 500 rows either way, with no way to tell
  whether the top row was the start of the story or the middle of it. It now
  says how many earlier records were dropped and how far back it still
  reaches. Worst in exactly the case the viewer exists for: chasing something
  that keeps failing, where the repetition is what pushed the first occurrence
  out of the window.

- **MemoryMap refuses to start with more than one worker.** Its configuration,
  database handle, log buffer, unlock sessions and SearXNG subprocess are all
  one-per-process; with two workers each silently becomes per-worker, and the
  result is a log showing half of what happened, an unlock that works only
  sometimes, and two workers each believing they own the SearXNG they started.
  None of that fails loudly, so it is refused with an explanation rather than
  warned about. `python -m memorymap` was never able to hit this.

### Changed

- **SearXNG is presented as the recommended way to search**, not "an optional,
  self-hosted search engine", the one-click install works now, and it needs
  no Docker and no account. The default setting is deliberately still
  *Automatic*, which prefers SearXNG whenever it is running and falls back to
  DuckDuckGo until you have one, so search keeps working on a fresh notebook.
  (*SearXNG only* remains available and still refuses to fall back.)

- **Autocomplete is pinned off in the generated SearXNG settings.** It is the
  one thing in a search UI that leaks without a search being run, a fragment
  of every query goes to a third-party suggestion endpoint as it is typed.
  SearXNG already defaults it off; stating it explicitly means neither a
  hand-edited file nor a changed upstream default can turn it back on.

### Changed

- **The whole prompt is now sized to the model's real context window.** Every
  part of it: the instructions, the tool definitions, your retrieved notes,
  the conversation so far, and the results of anything the AI looks up, used
  to have its own separate limit, and nothing ever added them up. Together they
  came to roughly 11,300 tokens against a window that is commonly 4,096: nearly
  three times too big. When that overflows, the *start* of the prompt is what
  gets discarded, which is the part telling the AI what it can do, so the
  symptom was an assistant that suddenly forgot it had tools, rather than any
  error you could see.

  Each part is now a share of what's actually available, with room kept back
  for the reply. Small models get a tighter, working prompt instead of a broken
  one; large models get **more** than the old limits ever allowed, since those
  were sized for the smallest case and applied to everyone. If notes don't fit,
  the AI is told so it can search for the rest rather than answering as though
  it saw everything.

- **Replies are length-capped, so answers arrive instead of rambling.** Nothing
  bounded the response before. Local models generate one token at a time, so a
  long answer costs far more waiting than a long prompt does.

- **MemoryMap now tells Ollama how much context to allocate.** It previously
  sent no settings at all, so Ollama used its own default, typically 4,096
  tokens: no matter what the model was capable of. Asking for the right window
  is what makes the budgeting above true rather than optimistic. Capped at 8,192
  by default because a larger window costs memory; raise `max_context_tokens`
  in preferences if your machine has room.

- **The AI is given as many tools as its model can actually hold.** The number
  used to be fixed, tuned for a 4,096-token context, which is what Ollama
  falls back to when a model doesn't declare a size, not a fact about any
  particular model. Most current models declare 8k, 32k or far more, and were
  being rationed for no reason; genuinely small ones needed rationing harder
  than one number could express. MemoryMap now asks the model how much room it
  has and fits the tool list to it, keeping the most useful tools when they
  don't all fit and noting in the log what it held back. A 16k model gets
  everything; a 4k model gets a prioritised subset instead of quietly
  overflowing and forgetting it had tools at all.

### Fixed

- **"🎲 Another" in the Rediscover widget often did nothing.** It picked a note
  at random *including the one already on screen*, so a click could land back
  on the same note, 1 in 10 clicks on a ten-note notebook, half of them on
  two notes, and every single one when there was only one note to show. It now
  picks from the others, and says so instead of offering a dead button when
  there's only one note in the notebook.

- **Magic Add put relative reminders out by your whole timezone offset.**
  Reported: *"play league of legends in half an hour"* was scheduled for 10am
  the next day. Two things were wrong.

  The route built your clock as "UTC now, plus your offset" and then labelled
  the result UTC: an aware timestamp claiming `+00:00` while actually holding
  local wall-clock. The AI was told "now is 23:30+00:00" when that `+00:00`
  was a fiction, so when it answered with a timezone of its own (the natural
  thing, having been given one) that answer was trusted as-is and skipped the
  correction. The reminder landed out by exactly your UTC offset, ten hours
  in eastern Australia, which turns half an hour away into 10am tomorrow.
  Anyone on UTC never saw it.

  Separately, *"in half an hour"* was being handed to a 3B model to work out.
  That is arithmetic, and the answer varied with whichever model happened to be
  installed. **"In …" phrases are now resolved by rule before the AI is asked**
  - "in half an hour", "in 20 minutes", "in a couple of hours", "in an hour and
  a half", "in 3 days" and so on: which also means they work **with Ollama
  switched off**, where Magic Add used to refuse outright. Phrases that name a
  time rather than an offset ("at 8pm", "tomorrow morning") still go to the
  model, now inside a timezone frame that is actually true. The time phrase is
  taken out of the reminder text, so it reads "Play league of legends" rather
  than repeating "in half an hour" when it fires.

- **Copy buttons work when the app isn't on localhost.** Every copy in the app
  - a note, an answer, a code block, a log record, used `navigator.clipboard`,
  which browsers only expose in a *secure context*. On `http://localhost` that
  is satisfied, so this looked fine; reach the app at `http://192.168.1.20:8000`
  or through a tunnel and the entire API is `undefined`, and every copy button
  became a no-op that said "couldn't copy". Copying now tries the modern API,
  falls back to the older mechanism that works over plain http, and, if the
  browser refuses both: shows the text in a dialog with it already selected,
  so Ctrl+C still gets it out.

- **Gravity and Spread no longer pretend to work under the tree layouts.**
  Both scale the force simulation, which Tree and Radial tree do not run,
  their positions come from the hierarchy, so the sliders moved, saved their
  value, and changed nothing. They are now disabled and dimmed under those
  layouts, with the reason on hover, and restored when you switch back.

- **Custom CSS works under the new security policy.** Settings → Appearance
  applied your CSS by injecting a `<style>` element, which is precisely what
  the new `Content-Security-Policy` refuses: so the feature would have
  silently stopped working. It now uses an adopted stylesheet, which keeps the
  feature *and* the strict policy; the alternative would have been to permit
  inline styles everywhere, including any injected through note text.

- **Renaming or moving the app folder no longer breaks the launcher.** The
  app is installed into its own `.venv` by absolute path, so a renamed folder
  left the venv pointing at somewhere that no longer exists, and the
  "dependencies already up to date" check, which only watches
  `requirements.txt`, skipped the reinstall that would have fixed it. The
  launch then died with `No module named memorymap`. Both launchers now ask
  the venv whether it can actually import the app, which catches a rename, a
  move, and a half-deleted venv alike.

- **Picking a theme works every time.** A single earlier tweak, one palette,
  one light/dark choice: sat on top of every theme picked afterwards and
  cancelled that part of it, so a theme could appear to do nothing. Choosing a
  theme now clears the manual settings that theme covers, and leaves the ones
  it says nothing about alone.
- **Lagoon and Shallows refined.** Shallows is properly teal rather than
  indigo-tinted, and Lagoon's inset panels and secondary text are no longer
  washed out against their cards.
- **Background tasks shows SearXNG starting**, not just installing. A start
  waits up to 90 seconds for the service to answer, the longest silence in
  the app, and the one thing missing from the screen that exists to explain
  silences.
- **The AI emblem has one home.** It was squeezed into the Notes and Chat
  sidebar headings and absent everywhere else; it now sits in the header next
  to the AI status dot, on screen for every tab.
- **A long note no longer crowds out the rest of your notebook.** Ten notes
  are retrieved so the AI sees ten of them; one note of several pages used to
  fill the prompt on its own. Notes now go in capped, cut with a marker
  telling the AI exactly how to read the rest, which it could already do.
- **A chat's prompt stops moving between rounds.** The clock in the system
  prompt carried microseconds, and that line sits above your notes and the
  conversation so far. Ollama caches the prompt only up to the first
  difference, so every round of every turn re-read the whole thing from
  scratch. It is now to the minute, identical across the rounds of one tool
  loop, which is exactly where the re-reading was costing the most.
- **SearXNG moves to a free port instead of giving up.** Port 8888 is a
  popular number, and "close whatever has it" is advice that assumes you can.
  It now tries 8080, 8081, 8890 and 8899 in turn, and `MEMORYMAP_SEARXNG_PORT`
  picks one yourself. A SearXNG already answering on the wanted port still
  wins over a free one, that is ours from a previous run, and moving would
  start a second copy beside it.
- **The dashboard's widgets no longer go missing on a cold load.** Starting the
  app fetched your notes and rendered the open tab at the same time, so the
  dashboard could draw its brand-new-notebook card over a notebook full of
  notes; switching tabs and back fixed it, which is how it was noticed.

### Added

- **A new document, without leaving the note.** The *Add to document* picker,
  in the capture box and in a note's ⋯ menu: offers **＋ New document…**, so
  a note can go into a document that does not exist yet.
- **The app's icon is the app's icon.** The top bar now shows the favicon, so
  the mark in your browser tab and the mark above the tabs are the same thing.
  The generated emblem stays the hero on the dashboard and appears small and
  animated in the header beside the AI status dot, so it is on screen whatever
  tab you are on.
- **Search operators in the notes filter**: `tag:work`, `cat:recipes`,
  `is:pinned` / `private` / `linked` / `untagged`, `"exact phrase"`, and
  `-exclude`. Plain words now match in any order rather than as one substring.
  The heading shows "3 of 6" while a filter is active, matched words are
  highlighted in the results, and a ? button explains the syntax. All of it
  works with no AI running.
- **Saved filters**: name a filter and keep it as a chip above the notes list.
  Stored as a preference, so it survives a restart.
- **Private notes**: mark any note private and its text is encrypted at rest
  with AES-GCM. The design is an envelope, a random data key encrypts the
  notes, and your password only encrypts that key, so changing your password
  re-wraps 32 bytes instead of re-encrypting every note, which is where an
  interruption could otherwise lose data. Private notes are kept out of search
  and are never given to the AI, and their embeddings are deleted (a vector
  encodes what a note is about, so keeping one would leak the point). The key
  exists in memory only while the app is unlocked. There is no recovery if you
  forget your password: that is inherent to encryption, not a shortcut here.
- **Documents tab**: a markdown editor for long-form writing, with a live
  preview, autosave, `Ctrl+S`/`B`/`I`, `.md` and PDF export, and AI editing.
  Documents are a separate table from notes on purpose, a note is a captured
  thought, a document is something you sit down and write, so they never
  appear in note search or the graph. AI edits are always shown as a proposal
  to accept or reject, never written straight into the file.
- **Writing room** (Notes tab): write loose thoughts, get a drafted note back,
  then edit the draft or add more thoughts and it folds them in without undoing
  your changes. Starts folded so it doesn't add weight to the Notes tab.
- **Attach notes to a chat message**: a 📎 picker with search and multi-select.
  Attached notes go to the model ahead of retrieval and are flagged as chosen
  by you. Binned notes can't be attached.
- **Rename and delete categories**, from the Notes sidebar. Renaming onto an
  existing name merges the two; deleting keeps the notes and moves them to
  Uncategorised. Neither can lose a note.
- **Back-to-top button** on every tab except the graph, and the Notes panels
  (Activity / Tags / Recycle bin) return to the top when opened.
- **Settings navigation is grouped**, the AI, your notebook, system, getting
  help: instead of eleven flat buttons. Appearance is unchanged.
- **Settings → Background tasks shows everything that's running**, not just
  two of them. It knew about re-indexing and model downloads; the embedding
  model loading at startup (a ~90 MB download the first time) and the SearXNG
  install (several minutes) both ran with nothing on that screen to say so,
  which reads as the app being broken rather than busy. The list now comes
  from the server, with a live step for each job, a progress bar where there
  is a real number to show, and a Quit button only on the jobs that can be
  stopped safely.
- **Notes and documents are joined up.** The capture box has an **Add to
  document** picker, so a note can be attached to what you're writing as you
  save it rather than afterwards. The note then carries a 📄 chip that opens
  that document, and the document lists the notes it draws on, each with a
  detach button. Detaching removes the connection and never the note; binning
  a note takes it out of the document's list on its own. A note you wrote
  before the document existed can be added afterwards, too, **📄 Add to a
  document** in a note's ⋯ menu picks from the documents you have, and the ×
  on the note's 📄 chip detaches it again without going to find the document
  first.
- **The graph has layouts.** A picker for how the notes are arranged: the
  force-directed **web** as before, a **tree**, notebook → category → note,
  reading left to right, with a note's replies branching off the note they
  answer: and a **radial tree**, the same shape wrapped into a circle. Most
  notebooks have far more filing than links, and a force graph of
  mostly-unlinked notes is a cloud of dots; a tree shows the structure that is
  actually there. Your choice is remembered.
- **Both trees are legible at the size of a real notebook.** Reported with a
  photo, "the graph tree and radial are a bit hard to read and aren't neat" ,
  of 29 notes squeezed into the panel's height at eighteen pixels a row. The
  tree now gives every note the room a label needs and pans if that makes it
  taller than the panel, zooming out only when the whole thing nearly fits;
  labels sit beside their note and above their branch, joined by elbows rather
  than straight diagonals. The radial sizes its rings from the panel and the
  note count instead of a fixed radius, gives each category a wedge of its own
  so a one-note category is not squeezed against its neighbour, and rings by
  depth, notebook, category, note, reply, so a category that happens to
  contain a thread no longer sits a ring in from its siblings.
- **A Timeline tab.** Opening on days by default. Your notes on a time axis, in bands, one per category
  or tag: with the bucket size you choose, from days to years. A note sits
  where it is *about* when it says so ("the beans need netting next week"
  plots on that week, marked 🕓, with the date it was written on hover) and at
  when it was written otherwise. Click any note to open it.
- **Notes remember what "tomorrow" meant.** A note saying "the deadline is
  next Friday" is correct the day it is written and misleading forever after,
  and nothing recorded which Friday it was. Every note's relative time
  phrases, tomorrow, last week, in three days, next Friday, two months ago,
  are now worked out when it is saved and kept beside it, shown as a small
  chip (`🕓 last week → week of Jul 20`) with the full date on hover. The
  phrase is always shown next to the date, because the resolution is a rule
  rather than a fact and you should be able to disagree with it. The AI gets
  them too, so it can answer questions about a note's own dates instead of
  guessing. It is plain pattern-matching, not an AI feature: it works with
  Ollama off, and it can never stop a note being saved. Private notes are
  excluded, and marking a note private removes anything already stored.

### Changed

- **A message is only offered the tools it plausibly needs.** Every tool is
  described to the model again on every round of every message, and all of
  them together were about three quarters of what it read before reaching
  your question: on a small model, most of the window. A question now
  carries the reading tools; "remind me…" adds the reminder ones; "tidy up my
  notes", which could mean anything, still gets everything. Measured: the
  fixed overhead of a typical question drops from ~3,157 tokens to ~1,439.
  It only decides what is *offered*, a tool is never blocked from running,
  and Settings → Tools can turn it off.
- **Skills are jobs now, not saved prompts.** A skill was a name and a string,
  and clicking one dropped that string into the chat box, which is why asking
  the AI to make one only ever produced another sentence. A skill now carries
  ordered **steps**, an explicit **tool allowlist**, and declared **inputs**
  it asks you for before it runs, and `save_skill` accepts all of them so the
  AI can write a real one. Skills with only a prompt keep working exactly as
  before.
  - **Naming a skill's tools makes it work on a small model.** Only those
    tools are offered for the run, 1,963 characters of schema for "Auto-tag
    my notes" instead of the full registry's 10,215: and calling anything
    outside the list is refused rather than merely discouraged. That leaves
    far more of a 4k context window for the actual question.
  - **Running one is a job, not a paragraph.** Each step is its own turn, so
    the steps tick off as they finish, and a step that fails is named with the
    reason instead of the run quietly doing less than it claimed.
  - **A run ends in what changed**, every note it wrote, with a button to see
    it and a button to put it back. Nothing is taken on trust from the model's
    own account of what it did.
  - **A skill asks for what it needs first.** "Draft an email" has a box for
    who it's to and what it's about, instead of spending a chat round asking.
  - The ten built-in skills moved out of the frontend and are served by the
    API, so the AI can list and run them too, it used to answer "you have no
    skills" while ten were on screen.

### Fixed

- **SearXNG couldn't be imported on Windows at all.** With the install
  finally finishing, the start died on `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'pwd'`, a POSIX-only module SearXNG imports at the top of one file. It is
  the only such import in the whole package, and the only thing it's used for
  is naming the current user in an error message that can't be reached without
  a Valkey database. A stand-in module now goes into SearXNG's own virtualenv
  where the platform hasn't got one.
- **The install said it had worked when it hadn't.** Its final check was
  `import searx`, which passed on Windows while the thing that actually runs,
  `searx.webapp`, could not be imported. It checks that now, using the same
  settings a real start uses.
- **The chat box couldn't grow.** It was a one-line `<input>`, so a
  three-sentence question scrolled sideways inside a box the width of the chat
  pane and you couldn't read what you'd written before sending it. It now
  grows with the text up to a cap. Enter still sends; **Shift+Enter** writes a
  newline, which a single-line box couldn't offer at all.
- **One long note filled the whole list.** Notes past about ten lines are now
  clamped with a fade and a "Show more", so the list stays a list. Only notes
  that genuinely overflow get one, a note you can already read in full never
  grows a button.
- **The app was naming the wrong embedding model.** Settings → Models said
  "Built-in (all-MiniLM)", it had been `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for two
  changes, and the only way to find out was to watch it download from Hugging
  Face in the log. Reported by someone who did exactly that. The name now
  comes from the running service rather than a string in the interface, so it
  cannot drift again, and the built-in option says it downloads on first use
  instead of claiming it needs no download.
- **The SearXNG install had no progress and no output**, so a working install
  and a hung one looked identical for several minutes. It now shows which of
  five stages it is in, a bar that moves (the download reports real bytes),
  and the lines pip is printing as it prints them, which is what actually
  tells you it is alive while a bar sits still. Both appear on the Web search
  screen and in Settings → Background tasks.
- **A finished install left "Installing SearXNG…" on screen** under a badge
  that said "Stopped", reported with a photo, and the install had in fact
  succeeded. That line now always says something current.
- **SearXNG now installs, starts and answers.** Five separate bugs, none of
  them in its log, because three of them happened before it wrote a line.
  - *`git clone` can never work on Windows.* Four files in the SearXNG
    repository have a colon in the name (`…/searxng.conf:socket`), which
    Windows refuses: git fetches everything and then dies at the checkout,
    leaving a half-written folder behind. `pip install <tarball-url>` unpacks
    the same files, so the no-git path was broken there too. The archive is
    now downloaded and unpacked by the app, skipping the handful of members a
    filesystem can't hold (nginx/uwsgi deployment templates) and any that
    would escape the folder. git is no longer used.
  - *`pip install -e .` can never work anywhere.* SearXNG's setup.py imports
    `searx`, which imports `msgspec`, which pip's isolated build environment
    does not have. The requirements go in first now and the package is built
    with `--no-build-isolation`, as SearXNG's own tooling does.
  - *A plugin killed it at boot.* `tracker_url_remover` downloads a rules file
    from clearurls.xyz during startup and doesn't catch a failure, so an
    offline or proxied machine lost the process before it bound the port. The
    generated settings turn it off; MemoryMap strips tracking parameters
    itself.
- **…and two Windows-only bugs, both a POSIX idiom that means something else
  on Windows.**
  - *"…\data\searxng\src does not appear to be a Python project: neither
    'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found."* The installer skipped the
    download whenever that folder existed, then handed it to pip. Reinstalling
    made it permanent rather than fixing it: the wipe used
    `rmtree(ignore_errors=True)`, git marks `.git/objects` read-only, Windows
    enforces that: so the writable files went, the folder stayed, and the
    wipe reported success. Now the question asked is whether the folder
    *contains a project*, the wipe clears the read-only bit (moving the tree
    aside if it still can't delete it) and says what survived, and an install
    isn't called done until `import searx` works in the new virtualenv.
  - *"SearXNG started but never answered."* The liveness check was
    `os.kill(pid, 0)`, on Windows any signal but CTRL_C/CTRL_BREAK goes to
    `TerminateProcess`, so checking whether the instance was alive killed it.
    The Web search screen polls status every three seconds, so it was killed
    seconds after every start.
- **One wide code block widened the whole page.** "Ask about this" renders a
  fetched page into the chat, and a wide code block, a nine-column table or a
  long URL pushed the layout sideways: a horizontal scrollbar, and text that
  read as scaled up because every paragraph had been stretched to the width of
  the widest thing on screen. Measured at 1280px, the document was 3425px
  wide. The cause was CSS automatic minimum sizing in two places, a `1fr`
  grid track and a flex item with `min-width: auto`, which is what stopped
  the `overflow-x: auto` already set on code blocks and tables from taking
  effect. Now 0 overflow across six tabs at four widths.
- **The top bar overflowed itself by up to 215px.** The block meant to let the
  tab strip scroll declared `flex`, but so did the base rule ~70 lines later
  at equal specificity, so the tabs stayed rigid at 579px and the header
  controls were squeezed to 76px around 201px of buttons, Settings, the lock
  and the theme toggle pushed out of the window. Worst in the desktop shell,
  whose 1200x800 window lands at 800–960 CSS pixels on a scaled display. The
  documented degradation ladder (wordmark → status pill → tab padding → tabs
  scroll) now actually happens, and the scroll fade is measured rather than
  guessed from a breakpoint.
- **Accent swatches did nothing while any theme was selected.** `[data-accent]`
  rules sit near the top of the stylesheet and `[data-palette]` rules near the
  bottom, both the same specificity, so the palette won on source order, and
  every theme selects a palette. An explicit pick is now an inline custom
  property, which beats both. Clearing an accent also left it applied, because
  `applyAppearance` re-applied every setting except that one.
- **The search-engine radios reset themselves.** Picking one saves nothing,
  "Apply & re-index" does: and the guard against the status poll was a focus
  check, so the moment focus moved the poll put the saved backend back and the
  setting looked stuck.
- **Editing an answer reverted when the chat was reopened.** The edit updated
  the message text, but a reopened chat replays the saved step timeline, which
  kept its own copy of the model's original wording.
- **Sketches couldn't be opened from the graph.** A sketch is a note plus a
  PNG, so its node showed the caption and nothing else, the drawing was
  unreachable from the map. Image attachments now preview in the popup and
  open full size on click.
- **"New note" on the dashboard did nothing** unless you had left the Notes tab
  on the capture section. Focusing an element inside a hidden sub-tab silently
  fails; an audit of every quick link from all three starting sections found
  this one and ten feature-catalog entries with the same fault.
- **Uploads failed with a 500** if the uploads folder had gone missing. For a
  sketch that lost the drawing while keeping the caption.
- **`bg-motion` had two conflicting defaults** in `APPEARANCE_DEFAULTS` after
  two sessions fixed the same blank-picker bug independently; the later one
  silently won, so the documented default was not the one anyone got.
- **Web search reported all its failures the same way.** No egress, a
  rate-limit challenge page, and a genuine no-results page all arrived as an
  empty list, which is why this was repeatedly investigated as a parser bug.
  Status and body length are now logged for every search (never the query),
  and the first two are named for what they are.
- **`pytest` didn't work in a fresh clone** without an editable install, though
  the README and CONTRIBUTING both say to run exactly that.
- **Keyword search only matched contiguous substrings.** "bread proving" found
  a note that "proving bread" did not: word order was something you had to
  guess. It now matches every word in any order across content and tags, and
  ranks results (exact phrase, then tags, then the opening of a note) rather
  than listing them newest-first. With no AI running this is the whole of
  search, not a fallback.
- **AI-only buttons looked usable with no AI.** Improve, Magic Add, Draft it
  and AI edit stayed enabled, so you'd type a note, press the button, wait, and
  get an apology. They're disabled with the reason in the tooltip. Save, Ask,
  search, tags, categories, reminders, documents and the graph are unaffected,
  they work fully without AI.
- **The status pill announced faults instead of capability.** "search AI
  unavailable: see Settings → Logs" pointed at a log viewer; it now reads
  "word search on · AI search unavailable" with the detail in the tooltip.
- **The command palette had gone stale**, it knew nothing about Documents, the
  writing room, or the newer settings screens.
- **The chat answered "hey" with a summary of your notebook.** Every message
  was retrieved-for and then answered "using ONLY the notes provided"; on an
  empty notebook a greeting got "I couldn't find any saved notes matching that
  question". Messages are now routed first, and small talk skips retrieval and
  the agent entirely. Anything the router isn't sure about falls through to the
  previous behaviour.
- **Message metadata was missing whenever tools were on** (the default). The
  agent path never read the token counts out of Ollama's response, so the line
  under each answer lost everything but the model name and elapsed time.
- **Editing a chat message didn't edit anything**: it copied the text into the
  input box and left the original exchange in place, so a one-word correction
  left the typo, the answer to the typo, and the fix all in the thread. The
  bubble is now the editor, and saving clears the replies that followed.
- **Only one of the five background-art styles ever ran.** The dropdown's
  values didn't match the implemented styles, the chosen style was read from a
  key nothing writes, and the draw loop called a method on an undefined
  variable. Two styles had no way to be selected at all. The intensity slider
  now scales the art itself, not just its opacity.
- **The Notes sections wouldn't collapse** and showed two chevrons each: two
  implementations of the feature were both live, so every click toggled twice.
- **Reminders landed at the wrong time.** The due field opened at 9am tomorrow
  rather than now, and Magic Add was given the time in UTC, so every relative
  phrase ("tomorrow evening") resolved against the wrong clock.
- **The graph node popup could hang off the bottom of the map**, it was
  positioned before the note loaded, then grew as its chips and buttons
  rendered.
- **Note timestamps were misaligned** from card to card: two `margin-left:auto`
  in one flex row split the free space between them.
- **Jumping to a note looked like nothing happened**, the highlight started
  fading as the scroll began, so it was gone by the time the note arrived.
- **The markdown export navigated the app away** instead of downloading: a
  plain link carries no auth header, so the server's 401 was rendered in place
  of the app.
- Dependency versions are capped, so an upstream major release can no longer
  break a clean install.

### Added

- **Learnability**: a first-run welcome tour (5 slides, re-runnable), a new
  Settings → Help section, and a searchable "Tools & features" directory of
  everything the app can do (reached from the dashboard quick links).
- **Dashboard welcome banner**: an AI-written greeting (`GET
  /insights/greeting`, cached per time-block, with handwritten fallbacks
  whenever the local model is unavailable), a line summarising your notebook,
  a live clock, and one-tap quick actions. The greeting phrase never contains a
  name: the display name is added from preferences. The Reminders tab shows a
  live clock too, so "now" is always visible.
- **One-click launchers**: `start.bat` (Windows) and `start.sh` (macOS/Linux)
  create the virtualenv, install/update dependencies, copy `.env`, and start
  the app. They re-install only when `requirements.txt` changes.
- **Accessibility**: interactive chips are now real buttons (focusable,
  Enter/Space), and the note-card ⋯ menu supports ↑/↓/Home/End/Esc.
- **Reminders**: priority (low/normal/high) and recurring
  (daily/weekly/monthly) fields, priority colour-coding, automatic rescheduling
  when a recurring reminder is completed, and a "Magic Add ✨" box that turns
  natural language into a reminder via `POST /reminders/parse`.
- **Dashboard**: focus-timer widget (presets + custom minutes), activity
  heatmap (`GET /insights/heatmap`), weighted tag cloud
  (`GET /insights/tag-cloud`), a personalised greeting with a `display_name`
  preference, dense grid packing, and a per-widget Wide/Narrow toggle.
- **Appearance**: regrouped into scannable sections, plus a custom accent
  colour, four new accent presets (Sunset, Ocean, Mint, Grape), a custom page
  background, corner-rounding slider (`--radius`), glass blur-strength slider
  (`--glass-blur`), a Spacious density, five background-art styles (Aurora,
  Constellation, Waves, Floating orbs, Mesh gradient), and an advanced
  custom-CSS box.
- **Chat/AI**: an in-chat web-search toggle, per-exchange delete
  (`DELETE /conversations/{id}/turns/{index}`), in-place regenerate
  (`PUT /conversations/{id}/turns/last`) instead of stacking a second answer,
  tool-activity chips that persist across reloads, four more built-in skills,
  and the `get_current_time` + `summarize_notes` tools.
- **Graph**: Gravity/Spread physics sliders, a click-to-edit node popup, a
  Labels toggle, a plain-language stats line, connection-count tooltips, node
  halos, and highlighted "hub" notes. The dashboard constellation gains a
  caption and a category colour key.
- **Notes**: sticky category sidebar, collapsible Capture / Ask / Browse
  section cards with remembered state, and a richer markdown renderer, GFM
  pipe tables, blockquotes, horizontal rules, `####`–`######` headings,
  `~~strikethrough~~`, task-list checkboxes, and bare URLs.

### Fixed

- **Lower chat latency and a smoother typing indicator.** `/chat/stream` now
  flushes a first byte immediately and runs retrieval inside the stream, so the
  UI no longer appears frozen during a cold-start search. Live-markdown
  re-rendering is throttled to cut main-thread jank on long answers, and
  anti-buffering headers were added.
- The dashboard no longer breaks when a widget renderer is synchronous, one
  failing widget can only spoil its own card.
- Settings checkboxes stacked correctly instead of running together (the
  `display: block` rule targeted the wrong container).
- The Appearance "Glass & effects" toggles no longer stack on one line (stale
  `#settings` / `#prefs-panel` selectors that matched nothing).
- A failed startup call no longer stops the rest of the app from loading, and
  an unreachable server fails fast with a clear message instead of hanging.
- `requirements.txt`, two optional extras were written as literal
  `pip install …` lines, which made pip reject the whole file.

### Added

- Repository documentation & tooling pass: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (a full
  project overview), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, this changelog, GitHub
  issue/PR templates, and a rewritten README.
- CI upgraded to lint with ruff and run the test suite across Python 3.11, 3.12,
  and 3.13, with concurrency-cancellation and manual dispatch.
- CodeQL static security analysis workflow (push / PR / weekly).
- Dependabot config for weekly pip and GitHub Actions updates.

### Added

- **Uninstall Ollama models from the app.** Settings → Models lists installed
  models with their size and a Remove button; the models in use (chat, utility,
  embeddings) are protected. Backed by a new `/models/delete` endpoint.
- **Keyboard-shortcuts cheat-sheet.** Press `?` (or use the command palette) for
  a dialog of all shortcuts.
- **Dashboard: more widgets & cleaner layout.** New "Top tags" and "Recently
  added" widgets; the "Drag widgets" hint now shows only in edit mode; widget
  bodies are height-capped so one tall widget no longer leaves big gaps; and all
  widgets share one consistent internal spacing.
- **Reminders: snooze, edit, presets.** Snooze (+1h / tomorrow), inline edit,
  quick-due presets, group counts, and bidirectional relative times.
- **Editable skills, persona tooltips.** Edit a saved skill in place (rename and
  all), and hover a persona in the chat picker to see what it does.
- **More appearance options.** Nine accent colours, a Font choice
  (System / Serif / Mono), and a Reduce-motion toggle; subtle button press
  feedback throughout.
- **Action skills: skills that actually *do* things.** Skills can now be
  marked "can make changes": running one turns on the AI's tools for that
  message, so it uses them instead of only answering (destructive steps still
  ask first). Two new tool-using built-ins, 🏷 Auto-tag my notes and
  🔗 Link related notes: and a "can make changes" checkbox when you create
  your own. Action skills are marked with a ⚙ in the chip row.
- **Per-note "Re-evaluate with AI".** A ⋯-menu action on every note that
  re-runs the AI to refresh its confidence (and category, unless you filed it
  yourself) and suggests topic tags and links to related notes, each applied
  with a click, inline on the card. Backed by `POST /entries/{id}/reevaluate`
  and a new `librarian.suggest_tags`; every step is best-effort so it still
  works (with empty suggestions) when the AI is offline.
- **Chat enhancements.** Per-message actions revealed on hover, copy any
  message, **edit & resend** your last question, **regenerate** the last answer
  (re-runs it without a duplicate prompt bubble), and read-aloud; **export a
  conversation to Markdown**; role labels on every bubble; and a friendly
  empty-state welcome so the chat page isn't a blank rectangle.
- **Graph view enhancements.** On-screen zoom controls (＋ / － / fit-to-view)
  so zooming no longer depends on discovering scroll/pinch; hover-spotlight:
  pointing at a note dims everything except it and its directly-linked
  neighbours (shares one dimming pass with search so they never conflict); a
  "Hide unlinked" toggle to declutter the map to just the connected web; and a
  visual pass (accent focus ring + glow on the hovered node, a soft radial
  background wash, smoother node transitions).

### Fixed

- **"Ask your notebook": Retry/Copy/read-aloud buttons overlapped the answer.**
  The answer heading's action buttons used `float: right`, which escaped the
  heading and rendered on top of the answer box whenever the "answered by …"
  chip was long. The heading is now a flex row; the buttons sit inline on the
  right and wrap onto their own line when space is tight.
- **Clearer error when a chat model is picked as the Ollama embedding model.**
  Selecting a generation model as the search engine made Ollama answer
  `/api/embed` with a raw `501 Not Implemented` that gave no hint what was
  wrong. The app now detects this (501 / 400 / "does not support embeddings")
  and tells the user to pick a real embedding model such as `nomic-embed-text`.
- **Windows: `torch_xpu.dll` load failure (WinError 127).** After the
  `sentence-transformers` bump pulled a newer torch, the default Windows wheel's
  Intel GPU library failed to load and semantic search silently fell back to
  keywords. `requirements.txt` now installs the CPU-only torch build on Windows
  (all this app needs, and ~10× smaller); other platforms are unaffected. Added
  a README Troubleshooting section for anyone who already installed the broken
  wheel.
- Cleaned up lint issues flagged by ruff (ambiguous variable name, unused
  imports) so `ruff check` is clean.

### Ideas / not yet

- A GitHub Pages **landing page** (marketing/showcase only: the app itself is a
  local Python server and can't run on Pages).

## Development history

MemoryMap AI was built in numbered phases and lettered "waves." This is the
condensed record of what each one delivered.

### Phases 1–5: Core product

- **Phase 1: Walking skeleton:** server starts, entries stored in SQLite,
  tests green.
- **Phase 2: Make the AI real:** auto-categorising janitor + question-answering
  librarian + semantic search, verified end-to-end with a real Ollama model.
- **Phase 3: Web interface:** capture box, category sidebar, chat panel showing
  the answer *and* the raw results, confidence flags.
- **Phase 3.5: Model Manager:** pick & download Ollama models in-app; switch the
  embedding backend with a safe automatic re-index.
- **Phase 4: Core MVP:** single-user unlock, manual overrides, recycle bin,
  entry linking, guided mode, audit viewer, export, preferences.
- **Phase 5: Quick access + polish:** recent questions, most-used dashboard,
  optional AI profile, glassmorphism UI with dark mode.

### Waves A–I: Platform, power features, hardening

- **Waves A–D: App shell & power features:** tabbed UI, settings modal, log
  viewer, note threads/files/pins/tags, chat tab with personas and saved
  conversations, dashboard, reminders.
- **Wave E: Graph view:** Obsidian-style force-directed map (D3 vendored
  locally).
- **Wave F: Platform:** command palette (Ctrl/Cmd-K), markdown import/export,
  daily local backups + restore, PWA + mobile pass, opt-in web search, sketch pad.
- **Wave G: Agentic tools + skills:** the chat AI can create/tag/pin/link/delete
  notes and set reminders (destructive actions always confirmed), plus one-click
  skills.
- **Wave H: Voice & desktop:** local Whisper dictation (optional), read-aloud,
  and a `python -m memorymap --desktop` window (optional pywebview).
- **Wave I: Hardening:** GitHub Actions CI (offline test suite), accessibility +
  keyboard + loading polish.

### Later waves: UI & graph refinements

- **Wave K:** empty states, streak widget, high-contrast mode, larger tap targets.
- **Wave L:** UI rework, accessibility, usability, design.
- **Wave M:** graph filters + search + pinning, image thumbnails, sharing, batch
  operations.
- **Wave N:** graph fixes + auto-linking, AI writing help, a dedicated utility
  model, a tasks manager.
- **Wave O:** stale-cache and re-lock fixes, brand logo, tool toggles; fixed the
  agent hallucinating note creation; expanded Appearance settings.

### A model per feature

- The Chat tab, Write with Atlas, the documents AI assistant and the Guide
  can each run on a model of their own. Settings, Models lists them: every
  row says which model it is on and whether that is its own choice or
  inherited, each row has a reset that is live only while it is overridden,
  and one button under the list hands every feature back to its default and
  says how many that is. The same picker is in each surface's own menu, so
  changing one does not mean walking to Settings. A feature left alone
  follows the model it inherits, so changing the chat model still changes
  it.
- The Notes sub-tab is called "Write with Atlas". The tab button said "Write
  with AI" while the panel it opens was already headed "Write with Atlas".
- The Guide's send button reads as pressable again. It was never disabled:
  it was painted in the app's secondary tier while the field beside it was
  at full strength.
- The Guide's thinking is a labelled block that folds away when the answer
  starts, rather than a line and a half of clipped grey text.
