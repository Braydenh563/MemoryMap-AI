"""The "Ask Atlas" offer is never a two-line capsule (INBOX 464 (16)).

At 390 Chat's offer was a 320x46 pill holding two lines ("Ask Atlas: What
can Atlas change in my notebook?") and the Notes empty state's 332x46. On a
phone the offer takes `--radius-md`, which holds one line or two, and Chat's
says its question shorter (one line, 214x44). Desktop keeps the pill.
