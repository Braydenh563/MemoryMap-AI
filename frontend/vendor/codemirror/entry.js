// Added 2026-09-09 for three of the file types `GET /documents/file-types`
// already offers and the editor could not highlight. Measured cost for the
// three together: +7,658 bytes raw, +2,476 gzipped, under 1% of the bundle.
// `properties` is the INI mode; CodeMirror has no mode called `ini`.

// **PHP is deliberately absent**, and the number is the reason:

// bytes raw and +28,563 gzipped on its own, 10.6% of this bundle for one
// language. DOCUMENTS_PLAN records the decision.
// Added 2026-10-10 (Brief 42, each sized before it landed, gzip -9 against
// this bundle): the merge view, to compare the editor with a saved version
// and take or undo one hunk (+29,294 raw, +10,014 gzipped); the minimap, off
// by default (+15,676, +5,235); Visual Basic and VBScript, two legacy modes
// (+9,926, +3,340). Indentation markers were measured too (+1,647) and left
// out: `docIndentGuides` in documents-code.js already draws them.
