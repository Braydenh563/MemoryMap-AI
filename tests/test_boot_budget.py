"""What a cold launch downloads before the lock screen, held down (audit
2026-10-05, FE-06).

WORLD_CLASS_PLAN H7 measured boot JS going 1,699 to 1,072 KB against a 1 MB
line on 2026-09-24 and named `boottime.js` the gate; nothing ran it, no test
bounded a boot asset, and the audit found 1,384 KB nine days later. This
reads every `<script src>` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` in `index.html`,
takes each one's bytes as served (the app's own stripped of comments,
`api/asset_strip.py`; a vendored file as it is), gzips them as the server
does, and fails over the caps. Lazy bundles (`LAZY_MODULES` in app.js) and
the p5 the emblem fetches after load are not in it: this is the boot.

The caps are the measured totals plus 2%, and only ever go down. When a
change is worth more boot bytes than that, the answer is the next surface
out of the boot (a lazy bundle), not a bigger number here.

#: 2026-10-05, measured by this test after the serve-time strip: 38 boot
#: scripts 691,724 bytes gzipped (the app's own 599,265 plus d3's 92,459;
#: the largest of the app's, avatars.js, 91,517), 12 stylesheets 179,712.
#: Before the strip the audit measured 1,384 KB of boot JS and 810 KB of CSS.
#: Plus 2%.
#: 2026-10-05, audit FE-07: d3 left the boot (it comes with the graph and
#: library bundles) and the template picker and a few guards left app.js:
#: 37 scripts, 589,299 bytes. Plus 2%.
#: 2026-10-05, the integration branch after search-boot-1005 merged: 590,758
#: (the note edit form, the full backup's two handlers and seven other
#: one-caller helpers moved into the lazy files that call them, and 63
#: same-bundle guards dropped). The measure rounded up to the next 100.
#: After claude/notes-flow-rebuild 143b240 merged (616's form, skeletons):
#: 589,955, with the embedding models list, the edit form's close and the
#: Settings bar's New listener moved to their lazy files.
#: And after 88227db (621, 622): 589,719.
#: And after the Atlas merge (f22bd43), with the companion's menu and
#: enlarged view in companion-menu.js (lazy): 589,093.
#: And with the s2 agent's list drag-select edge scroll (selection.js, +489,
#: boot): 589,597, a raise the next agent undid: the edge scroll moved whole
#: into drag-edge.js (lazy, preloaded three seconds after boot, like
#: quick-note.js) and the note edit form's formatting strip
#: (`noteEditToolbar`, only `renderEditForm` calls it) into
#: note-edit-panels.js: 588,354, so the cap is back below 589,100.
BOOT_JS_CAP = 588_400
#: 2026-10-10 INBOX 767: the no-model notice's row and phone grid cost 58
#: gzipped bytes, paid for by the blank lines of 08-consistency.css (61), so
#: the cap holds; the next CSS goes in a lazy file.
