"""INBOX 647, the owner: "when rotating objects on the whiteboard the
connections and links don't automatically update in their connection position
until I move the object I rotated". A move redrew the links touching the
dragged item each frame (`wbUpdateLinkedSketches`); the three turns (a card's
grip, a box's grip, a selection's grip) set `rotation` and saved without it,
so the link stayed on the unturned box until the next move. Measured by
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbrotatelinks.js`: FAIL before, PASS after."""
