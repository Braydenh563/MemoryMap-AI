"""INBOX 720 (the owner, 2026-10-06): "I accidentally pressed ctrl v randomly
on the app when on the ask tab and it started captioning the image". A board
left open in the Library kept its view and canvas un-hidden while another tab
was on screen, so the board's document-level paste took the image. The board
answers a paste only while its canvas is rendered. And the Ask history's
buttons are rounded squares like every other quiet icon button."""
