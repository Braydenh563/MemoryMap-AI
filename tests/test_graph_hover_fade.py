"""The owner, 2026-10-04: "when I hover over parts of the graph, the labels
and stuff just suddenly appear and it is very visually confronting".

Measured before with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphfade.js`: a non-neighbour's
dot, a non-neighbour's link, a dimmed note's name and the hovered note's
name each went from rest to their end value in the first frame (largest
single-frame step 1.0, no frame in between). The canvas has no CSS, so each
of them now carries a lit-ness that travels per frame; these tests run the
label pass and the step under node against a recording context, and read the
source for the parts a canvas hides from the lints."""
