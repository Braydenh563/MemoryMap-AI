"""Brief 42: Word files read by Mammoth and written by docx, in the browser.

The owner's decision (DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 7, superseded row, INBOX 765):
both vendored, credited, loaded only when a Word file is imported or
exported. The round trip itself is measured by
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docs42d.js` in Chromium: a picture, a nested list, a
code block and two suggestions, out and back.
