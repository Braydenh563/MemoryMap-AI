"""The companion is stacked by what it is perched on.

INBOX 431 (5), the owner: "if it is perched on like a chat message bubble or
a library card, when it scrolls with them it should probably go behind the
top bar like the thing it is perched on not in front of it. If say it is
sitting on or perched on an element like the top bar, then it would be in
front".

Riding a panel's scroll, it is drawn in a band clipped to the area its perch
is seen in. The band was widened, at placement, to take in a head that
reached over the top bar (or a bar that sticks in the area) so a perch at
the very top of a panel was not cut where it stands; and it stayed widened
while the panel scrolled, so the figure was carried up over the bar its
perch had gone under (measured, `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/companionstack.js`:
62px of it past its perch's clip line on a chat message, a library card and
a note card, 41px over the top bar itself at the Large size). Now a shutter
inside the band, moved by the same scroll as the rider, brings the clip line
back down to the bar's edge pixel for pixel as the panel scrolls away from
where it was perched, and up from the bottom bar the same way; at rest it is
drawn whole. On the top bar itself it rides nothing and stays in front.
