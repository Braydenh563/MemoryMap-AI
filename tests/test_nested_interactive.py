"""No interactive control inside another one (INBOX 433, WCAG 2.2 4.1.2).

axe-core's `nested-interactive` rule, measured with
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/axe.js`: every Library card was an `<article
role="button">` holding its own tick and its own ⋯ (35 nodes across the
two themes), and six Settings fold heads were `<summary>`s holding their '?'.
A screen reader announces the outer control and cannot reach the inner ones
as themselves, and the platform's own keyboard rules for a button do not
expect anything focusable inside it.

The fix is the accessible card (DESIGN.md, the recipe index): the card is
not a control. Its title is the one control that opens it (`cardOpener`,
menus.js), and that title's click area is stretched over the card by a
`::after` overlay, so a click anywhere on the card still opens it while the
tick and the ⋯ sit above the overlay as controls of their own.
