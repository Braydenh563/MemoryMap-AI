"""The selection rectangle does not re-layerize the page (INBOX 410: "drag
selection on the whiteboard and mindmap is laggy as well").

`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/marqueeperf.js` is the measurement: a real 80-move drag
over a board of text boxes and a map of topics, traced. The rectangle was an
SVG `<rect>` whose attributes were rewritten on every pointermove, and every
such write re-layerizes the whole page, a cost that grows with the board. On
a map of 200 topics, 60 frames of `<rect>` writes cost 445ms of Layerize, and
so did 60 frames of `transform` writes to promoted boxes (419ms), which is why
the fix is not that; 60 frames of canvas drawing cost 8.7ms.

The suite cannot trace a browser, so this holds the shape the trace came from:
the rectangle is drawn on a canvas, at most once a frame, with no style or
attribute write per move; and the release restyles only what changed.
