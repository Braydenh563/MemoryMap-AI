"""What a topic question's notes hold, read for the overview answer (INBOX 787).

The owner, on the composed answer: "the composer is still pretty barebone, has
no life to it and I may as well just ignore it and use the matching records".
Asked "games notes" or "what did I write about uni", it quoted one or two
sentences and stopped. A person asked the same thing would say how many notes
there are and when they were written, what most of them are about, the notes
grouped by that, each with its day and one short line, and what links them.

This module is the reading half, on plain data and with no wording: which
questions ask for an overview (`topic`), which of the notes found are about
the topic (`members`), the threads that group them (`themes`), the names that
link them (`shared_names`) and the line of a note that best stands for it
(`best_line`). `composer._overview` says it, every clause a quote, a measured
count or day, a word of the question, or a word of the notes (`term`).
