# **pytest's exit 5 is "no tests were collected", and it is a failure here.**
#
# The reading that would make it a pass is that a change touching no tested
# file legitimately runs nothing. That case never reaches pytest: `--changed`
# checks `${#TARGETED[@]}` first and records `changed-tests (none matched)` as
# *skipped*, with the base it compared against printed above it, so an empty
# selection is already said out loud rather than shown as a green test run.
#
# What is left, by elimination, is pytest being handed test files that yield
# no tests: a new test file with nothing in it yet, a file whose tests were all
# renamed out from under the selection, a collection error swallowed into an
# empty run. Every one of those is the selection and reality disagreeing, which
# is the same silence an empty `--changed` used to print green, and the gate
# that let two agents measure nothing was fixed tonight for exactly it.
#
# So it fails, and it says which failure it is: "no tests failed" and "no tests
# ran" want different answers from whoever is reading the five lines, and a
# bare red step name gives neither. Only pytest returns 5; `node --check`
# returns 0 or 1 and ruff 0, 1 or 2, so nothing else can land here by accident.
#
# The five lines are the whole diagnosis, and that is not a stylistic
# preference: `pytest -q` on an empty collection writes one byte to its log
# (measured), so "logs: .gate/changed-tests.log" leads to a blank file and the
# step name is all the reader gets.
