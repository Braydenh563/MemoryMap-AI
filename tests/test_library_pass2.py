"""The Library's second pass and the list conventions it brought, held.

docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/pass2.md. Two kinds of check:

- `libraryTitleAndPreview` is pure string work, so it runs in node against
  the cases that were measured wrong on a seeded notebook: an untitled note
  printed its first line twice (as the title and again as the preview), and a
  document's snippet began with its own title.
- The conventions (right-click opens the row's own menu, arrows between
  cards, Shift+click ranges, Escape / Ctrl+A / Delete on a selection, the
  Library keeping its scroll) live in delegated listeners that no unit test
  reaches, so their load-bearing pieces are held here by shape, and
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/listconventions.js` drives them in Chromium.
