"""One reader of date words and units (CHAT_PLAN "The deterministic
foundation", decision 46 and section 3's rule): no file outside
`ai/recognise.py` and `entry/timewords.py` compiles a date-word or unit
pattern, or tests a date word to turn it into a window.

The scan is F0's (`scratchpad/reader_count.py`). The count was 6 files when
F0 measured it and 9 on the head Brief 65 started from (Brief 39 added
`utilities`, `factgraph` and `insights`); after Brief 65 it is 1:
`ai/composer.py`'s `_DATE_CUE`, the engine's file, which scores a sentence as
dated and turns nothing into a value. The set below only shrinks: a new
reader fails this test, and a reader that delegates must leave the set here.
