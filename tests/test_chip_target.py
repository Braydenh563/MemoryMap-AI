"""An interactive chip's target is `--target-min` whatever it paints (audit FE-14).

The category and "Add tags" chips on a note card were 24px targets under
DESIGN.md's 28px floor. They keep their 24px paint and take the floor through
a transparent overhang, the switches' pattern; a chip clipped to shrink with
its row is clipped across only, or the overhang goes with it.
