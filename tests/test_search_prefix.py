"""Typing part of a word finds it in the universal finder.

The owner, 2026-09-21: "on the universal find anything search, notes, boards,
and documents etc only match on a whole word. so they will only appear if I
write 'test' and not 'tes' but idk if that's intentional or not."

It was not intentional, and the reason recorded for the threshold that caused
it could not happen: the comment said three letters would turn "the" into
"the*", but "the" is a stopword and `query.search_terms` drops it before the
prefix stage ever sees it. These tests hold both halves, so neither the
threshold nor the premise can quietly move back.
