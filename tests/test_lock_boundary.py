"""The lock screen is this app's only privacy boundary.

ROADMAP.md ranks auditing it first, and says why: shortcuts once ran behind
the lock screen and were found by a user pressing keys, not by a test.

The audit that produced this file drove the running app locked and checked
each avenue the roadmap named. **The server side already held**, `/entries`,
`/media`, `/documents` and `/reminders` all answer 401 while locked, and the
keyboard gate gave nothing away (the command palette, the agent palette, `/`
to focus search and the `g`-then-letter tab jumps were all refused, and a
`#hash` route did not unlock anything).

**The client side did not.** The overlay was a visual cover, not a purge:
with the notebook locked, `#entry-list` still held 61 notes and 3,431
characters of their text, `#library-grid` 5,089, and the documents list
6,422: one devtools click, one screen reader or one browser extension away
from being read. `purgeLockedContent()` closes that, and unlocking restores
everything because `startApp()` re-renders it.
