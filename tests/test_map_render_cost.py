"""A map render repaints what changed (MINDMAP_PLAN 13a, the render pass).

`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mapperf.js` is the real gate: it opens a 500-topic map
in a real Chromium and reports what a render costs after one topic has moved,
after every topic has moved, and when nothing has. This file cannot do that,
and nothing in it should be mistaken for the measurement. What it holds is the
*shape* those numbers came from, because each of these costs reads as ordinary
code and only shows up under a profiler:

    mapperf.js, 1440x900 light       50        200        500
    one topic moved, before       22.6ms    122.6ms    534.7ms
    one topic moved, after         7.9ms     19.8ms     47.8ms
    every topic changed, after    16.6ms     53.5ms    149.1ms
    open to painted, before      314.0ms    757.0ms   2022.3ms
    open to painted, after       393.1ms    537.2ms    965.6ms

Each rule here is one of those costs. They are written against the source
because the suite cannot open a board; if one fails, the question to ask is
"what does this do per render now", not "how do I word the rule differently".
