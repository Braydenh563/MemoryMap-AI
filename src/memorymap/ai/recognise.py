"""The one reader of numbers, dates, times, durations, units and contacts
(CHAT_PLAN "The deterministic foundation", module 1; decisions 46 and 56).

Before this, five readers each read time words their own way and disagreed
("last friday" was next Friday in one, "every morning at 7" was 19:00 in
another), and nothing read a unit at all. Now there is one:

- `recognise(text, *, now, locale)` returns every `Span` it reads, in order:
  number, ordinal, date, time, datetime, duration, recurrence, range, money,
  quantity (the unit table below, 150 units and more), temperature, email,
  url, phone, person, place, tag. Past and future both resolve; the tense is
  read from the sentence ("what did I do on Friday" is the Friday before). An
  ambiguous phrase ("2/11", "5 pounds", a month with no tense) gives both
  readings at the same offsets, the likelier with `rank` 0.
- The date reading `ai/when.py` used to hold lives here unchanged in shape:
  `resolve`, `parse_reminder_text`, `days_since`, `span`, `find` and `window`
  keep their signatures, and `when` re-exports them.
- The "in 20 minutes" offsets `ai/reminder_parser.py` read (`relative_delta`)
  and the unit and currency names `ai/utilities.py` converts with live here;
  both modules import them back.

No network and no app imports (decision 56; `tests/test_recognise.py` checks
the imports): currency rates stay in `utilities` with their date. The rule
`tests/test_one_reader.py` holds: no other file compiles a date-word or unit
pattern, except `entry/timewords.py`, which reads a saved note's own words.
