"""At phone width the board's context bar never covers the selection it edits
(uipolish-0924 item C, `#wb-context`).

Pinned to the top of the canvas, it sat over 3 of the sweep's 10 selections,
the ones high on the board (6080, 6719 and 319px2, measured by
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbcontextphone.js` at 390x844). Such a selection gets
the bar at the foot of the canvas, above the rail: 0px2 on all ten, two
fixed places, never on the rail or the top bar; 1440 keeps the floating bar.
