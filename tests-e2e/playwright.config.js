// Headless Playwright suite (roadmap ANALYSIS.md §31, ROADMAP.md §38.2).
//
// Two notebooks, two servers, two projects:
//
//   * "first-run" is a brand-new data dir: the account is made, nothing else.
//     Only `first-run.spec.js` runs there, because a fresh install is the one
//     state the other specs cannot leave alone (they all write notes).
//   * "notebook" is a realistic one, seeded by global-setup.js from
//     `fixtures/notebook.json` (75 notes in seven categories, 87 links, three
//     documents). Every other spec runs there. A notebook with filed notes is
//     what lets the no-model filing path (`ai/lexical_filing.py`) file a new
//     note at all, so capture and filing can be asserted end to end with no
//     model and no network.
//
// Why this suite grew from one smoke file (2026-10-05): the Python suite has
// thousands of tests and fakes every AI call and every browser, and the core
// flow, writing a note and having it filed, was broken for an unknown time
// without one of them failing. These specs drive the real UI against a real
// server and assert what a person would see after a reload.
//
// PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH, if set, is respected by Playwright itself. In CI,
// `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` puts a browser in the default
// cache and this config works unchanged.
//
// Local knobs (all optional):
//   MEMORYMAP_E2E_PORT      the notebook server's port (first-run uses +1)
//   MEMORYMAP_E2E_DATA_DIR  where the two data dirs go (wiped at start)
//   MEMORYMAP_PYTHON        the interpreter that runs the app
