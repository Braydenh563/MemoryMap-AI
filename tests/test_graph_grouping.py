"""INBOX 431 (6), the owner: the graph's default layout "looks messy and is
distributed weirdly". Measured on a 150-note, 8-category fixture
(`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphgroup.js`): the mean distance of a note from its
category's centre, over its distance from the map's, went from 0.85 to 0.38,
and the loose notes' ring round the map from 1.61x the linked notes'
distance from the centre to 1.24x. Off with View, Group by category."""
