"""Where the notebook disagrees with itself.

**This is the thing `LINK_TYPES` was built for and nobody ever built.** Its
own comment in `core/database.py` says so:

    `contradicts` is the one worth having built this for: a notebook that can
    show you where you disagreed with yourself is not something an embedding
    similarity score can ever produce, however well tuned.

That was true and it stayed unbuilt. `link_type` is writable only through
`POST /entries/{id}/links`, a person, by hand, choosing "Contradicts" from a
dropdown. So the notebook could *record* a disagreement it was told about, and
could never *find* one.

Everything else this app knows about connection answers "these are about the
same thing": embedding similarity, shared words, `[[wiki links]]`, threads.
None of them can tell agreement from disagreement, two notes that flatly
contradict each other are, to a vector, maximally similar. That gap is the
whole point of this module.

**Why this app can do it and a cloud notebook cannot.** Reading every
plausible pair of notes with a language model is an unbounded number of
tokens against a corpus that is entirely the user's private writing. Metered,
that is a bill nobody would pay to be told they changed their mind; sent to a
someone else's server, it is the most sensitive text a person owns. Here
inference is free and stays on the machine, so the notebook can afford to
actually read itself.

## What it looks for, and what it deliberately ignores

A *tension* is two notes that make claims which cannot both be right. Not two
notes on the same topic, not one adding nuance to another, not a plan that
changed because the facts changed.

Two rules keep this from becoming noise, and both matter more than the model
prompt does:

1. **Candidates come from pairs that are already about the same thing.**
   Contradiction is only possible between notes that share a subject, so this
   never scans all pairs, it takes the ones the existing similarity pass
   already produced. That bounds the work and removes the obvious false
   positives before a model is asked anything.
2. **Time is part of the finding, not decoration.** The interesting case is
   almost always a change of mind: written in March, contradicted in
   September. Two notes written the same afternoon that seem to disagree are
   usually one thought being refined. `MIN_GAP_DAYS` is what encodes that.

## Nothing is written without a person saying yes

Same policy as the auto-linker (`routes_entries.link_suggestions`) and for a
stronger reason: telling someone they contradicted themselves when they did
not is worse than telling them nothing. This module only ever *proposes*.
Accepting a tension is what creates the `EntryLink` with
`link_type="contradicts"`, an existing column, so there is no migration
here and the graph, the traversal weighting and Trace all understand the
result the moment it exists.
