"""Every "how long ago" reads a server time the same way (audit 2026-10-05,
FE-16).

Three formatters: `relativeTime` (sheets-selects.js) read through
`parseServerTime`, which treats a zone-less timestamp as the UTC the server
keeps it in; `dashRelativeTime` (dashboard.js) and `relativeWhen`
(shell-reminders.js) used `new Date(iso)`, which reads the same string as
local time, so the dashboard and a reminder's "in 2 hours" were off by the
offset for any time sent without a zone. Their wording differs on purpose
(the reminders say "in 2 hours"); how they read the time may not.
