"""A composed answer with no model in it: the notes' own sentences, shaped.

Asked for directly (INBOX 688, the owner): *"is there a way to do very good
imitations of ai responses but using string concatenation with the app when
the ai isnt available ... it needs to be VERY refined and well worded and
designed ... nice and understandable to read, well structured"*.

**The rule, which is the notebook's integrity and is not traded for fluency.**
Every factual clause of a composed answer is one of two things:

- the person's own words: a sentence or a list item from a note, quoted whole
  or lightly trimmed (a leading "So," or "Also," taken off, the first letter
  raised, a very long sentence cut at a word with an ellipsis), and cited; or
- a value the app measured: how many notes, the day each was written, whether
  a checklist item is ticked, which of the question's words no note found
  contains.

Only the connective tissue between them is written here, and it comes from
`PHRASES`, a closed list that says nothing about the world: "Separately,",
"Later, on", "None of these notes mention ...". No sentence is paraphrased, no half-sentence is joined to
another, and nothing is concluded: a yes/no question gets the closest sentence,
never a yes or a no. `compose` returns the answer as `parts` as well as text,
each tagged with what it is, so the tests hold every clause of every answer to
the notes it came from (`tests/test_composer_688.py`).

**Why this beside `extractive.py` rather than inside it.** The extractive
answer (INBOX 269) quotes the best forty-word window of each note. A window is
not a sentence: it starts and ends mid-thought, swallows the note's heading and
flattens a checklist into one line of dashes (measured on the showcase
notebook, docs/roadmap/archive/agent-remaining/composer688-1006.md). This works in
sentences and list items, reads what kind of question was asked, and lays the
answer out the way a careful reader would: the strongest sentence first, set
apart as a quote and attributed; the rest grouped by note under a measured
line; a timeline for a "when", the newest first for a "latest", two sides for
a "compare"; two notes that may disagree named; and the question's words that
no note found contains, said in one line.

**Read like a person wrote it (INBOX 725, the owner: "I want it soooo good it
is almost like a chat bot").** The rule above does not move; what changed is
how the quotes are strung together, each step measured on the showcase eval
(`tests/_composer_eval.py`) and kept because it moved a number:

- the first line is the answer: the lead sentence itself, its note named
  after it as the citation, once (INBOX 741: never "Your note ... says:",
  never a note named by its first words), a list of short entries said as one sentence ("lists four: A,
  B, C and D"), a checklist with how many are ticked, a broad question
  opened by how many notes mention it ("At least five of your notes mention
  “running”, from 20 August to 21 September");
- the other notes are joined by how they relate to what came before, by
  meaning (`_Meaning`: the embedder's cosine when it is running, shared
  words when not): no joiner or "And" for the same subject, "Later, on"
  for a newer note on the same thread, "Separately" for another topic, "But
  in a newer note" for two that may disagree; no joiner twice in an answer,
  one topic to a paragraph;
- a sentence other notes repeat is said once, with how many say it; a
  broad question's lead is the sentence the others lean towards (TextRank,
  `centrality`), the note named for the subject first;
- lead-ins ("So basically,") come off a quote from a tested list
  (`LEAD_INS`), and a picture's reading is introduced as the picture's;
- two or three next questions are built from what the answer found and did
  not say (`next`), and "tell me more" or "the second one" is read against
  the turn before (`follow_on`).

Pure and deterministic: the same question over the same notes gives the same
answer. The opening is chosen by a hash of the question, so two different
questions in a row do not open with the same words.

    Every note stays, in its place, with its id and every other field the
    prompt reads (category, dates, tags, the connected flag), so nothing the
    model was told about a note is lost and nothing is renumbered. Only
    `content` changes, and only for a retrieved note whose text is longer than
    what bears on the question:

    - a note with sentences the composer chose keeps its name and those
      sentences, in the note's order, "…" where text was left out;
    - a note with none keeps its name and its first sentence: retrieval found
      it by meaning or by a link, and the question's words may not be in it;
    - a note attached by hand, a document, a file or a mind map goes whole: the
      person chose it, it is the subject;
    - a note the cut would barely shorten (`BRIEF_WHOLE`) goes whole.

    A shortened note carries `briefed: True`; `librarian.note_for_prompt` says
    so after it, naming `get_note` when the model has tools. None when there is
    nothing to brief: a "newest notes" question (the newest are the subject),
    or no sentence chosen at all (the composer has no reading of the question,
    and the notes as they are are the honest fallback).

    `composed` is `compose()`'s result for the same question, when the caller
    has it (the route does: it shows it while the model writes).

    Returns `{"notes", "quoted", "shortened", "chars_before", "chars_after"}`.
