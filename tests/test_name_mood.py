"""A generated face reads a mood out of the name it is drawn for.

The owner: "would it be funny if for the generated avatar profile pictures,
the application detects the intent or mood from the name ... I have personas
called 'overly dramatic narrator', and 'depressed wizard', 'exitable
academic'", and then: "most people wont do that, so there needs to be some
other way as well ... like if I put in the word pandaSushi101, what would
that generate".

So `nameMood` (app.js) reads a name in four layers, most specific first:
mood words and the nouns that carry one; the way the name is typed (capitals,
punctuation, emoticons, emoji, a few numbers); and, when nothing says
anything, a personality drawn from the name's own hash, so every name still
gets a character and the same name always gets the same one. These tests run
the real function under node and pin what each layer decides.
