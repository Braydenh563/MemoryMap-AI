"""The Library counts boards one way (INBOX 464 (15)).

Measured on a notebook with one board ("Garden plan", empty): Library,
Everything said "Boards 1" and Boards & maps said "All 2". The cause is
`GET /whiteboard/boards`, which always returns the default scratch board
(`id: null`) whatever is on it, while `/library` lists boards that are notes,
and the default board is not one. The source is now one predicate,
`libraryListsBoard` (note-cards.js, loaded at boot): the default board is a
board the Library lists only when something is on it. The gallery's cards,
its chip counts, its tick sync (`wbVisibleBoards`) and the dashboard's Boards
widget all go through it.
