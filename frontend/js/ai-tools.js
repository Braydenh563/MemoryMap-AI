// ai-tools.js: the tasks manager, a model per feature, improve writing,
// tensions, link suggestions, keeping the look. Moved out of app.js on
// 2026-09-26 as one contiguous range (INBOX 426 cc,
// docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/appjs-split.md). A classic script sharing
// app.js's globals, loaded in app.js's old order; nothing in an earlier file
// calls into it while the page loads (scratchpad/appjs-map.js --check).

// --- Wave N: tasks manager (see and quit background jobs) ---------------------------

// The list is built by the server (GET /tasks), not assembled here from
// whatever happened to be in the model status. It used to know about exactly
// two jobs, a re-index and a model download, so the embedding model loading
// at startup and the SearXNG install, which is minutes long, ran with nothing
// on this screen to say so. Rendering whatever the server sends means the
// next background job appears here without touching this file.
// `payload` is the /tasks body when the caller has already fetched it, the
// status poll has, once, for the bar. Opening the panel passes nothing and
// fetches, so the list is filled the moment you get there rather than at the
// next tick.

// --- keeping the look across restarts (§35E) --------------------------------
//
// Reported as two bugs: *"the theme resets to default on every start"* and
// *"onboarding shows every time"*. They are one bug. Both were stored in
// `localStorage` and nowhere else, and the desktop shell does not reliably
// persist it: pywebview is a different browser with its own profile, and if
// that profile is not stable across launches then everything kept there is
// something the app forgets. Two symptoms, one storage, exactly as §35E
// predicted.
//
// The fix is a mirror, not a move. localStorage stays the thing every
// `appearancePref` read goes through: it is synchronous, it works with the
// server unreachable, and moving the reads would mean rewriting the whole
// appearance system to be async. The server keeps a copy, seeded back into
// localStorage on load when the local one is empty, so a shell that loses it
// gets it back, and a browser that keeps it never notices.

//: The keys worth surviving a restart. Explicit rather than "everything in
//: localStorage": this is written to the notebook's own preferences file, and
//: scroll positions and one-visit UI state have no business in there.
// The appearance half is `LOOK_KEYS`, the same list a saved custom theme
// snapshots: rather than a second hand-written copy of it. The first draft
// *was* a hand-written copy, and it guessed two key names wrong ("bgart",
// "bgart-motion" for what are really `bgArt`, `bg-style`, `bg-motion` and
// `bg-intensity`), so the background art would have been the one setting that
// still did not survive a restart. Deriving it cannot be wrong.
