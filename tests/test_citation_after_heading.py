"""Citations survive a heading followed by a list, live and reopened
(coordinator report: an Ask answer reopened from history was missing
in-text markers for two bullets under a "## Schedule and Frequency"
heading, though the Sources panel listed the note and earlier sections
kept their own markers).

**Reproduction attempted, not found.** Driven through the real pipeline
(fake_ollama's answer stream through `/chat/stream`, the real
`ground_answer_sentences`, a real saved `AskTurn`, a real
`GET /ask-history/{id}`) with a heading immediately followed by a two-item
list, one note grounding a paragraph earlier and a different sentence in
the list (the "same note cited twice, non-adjacently" shape), and bold
markdown ending a list item right before its period: the live SSE
`grounding` event and the reopened turn's `grounding` were identical in
every variation tried, and `addInlineCitations` (capture-ask.js, run
directly against the rendered markdown in a real DOM, `scratchpad/`
`ui-sweeps/citationheading.js`) placed every marker correctly in each case.

This holds what was verified as a regression test, on the theory that
"list items after a heading" was simply undertested before, not that a
fix landed here: if either the live/reopened grounding equality or the
frontend's own marker placement for this shape ever regresses, this is
what catches it. The report's own root cause remains open; the most
likely next step is the actual saved turn's stored `grounding`/
`raw_result_ids` from the owner's own notebook, which nothing here has
access to.
