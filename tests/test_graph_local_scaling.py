"""`/graph/local` (focus mode) at notebook scale (BACKLOG 29b item 4).

It used to load every note as an ORM object, index every link, thread and tag
and walk every link again for edge direction, on every call, to draw a
neighbourhood of a dozen notes. The topology (who is joined to whom) is now
built from columns only and kept once per version of the notebook, the way
centrality and the similarity sweep already were; a call reads only the notes
it draws.

The assertions pin the shape, not a wall clock (a clock failed on a busy CI
runner in tests/test_relations_kg2.py): five times the notes may cost a warm
call at most three times the time, and a warm call builds the topology zero
times. The numbers print with -s.
