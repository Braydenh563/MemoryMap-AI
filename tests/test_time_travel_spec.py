"""Time travel over meaning (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I5, H8, row 23): a question
answered from the notebook as it stood on a date, and a note's claims then
against now. `ai/timetravel.py` holds the reasoning; these are the spec's
"tests first", written from its own list:

* a note edited on three dates answers differently as of each date, citing
  the right revision;
* the then-and-now diff on the fixture reports one revised, one dropped, one
  new;
* an `as_of` before the notebook existed returns an empty, honest answer
  rather than today's;
* the gate: as-of retrieval under 1 s for a 200-candidate set.
