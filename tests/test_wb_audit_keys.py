"""The board's and the map's keys, as the INBOX 445 audit found them.

Four keys did two things or the wrong thing, each measured by driving the
real UI (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbaudit.js`):

* M picked the highlighter *and* armed the app's "m" quick-nav chord, so the
  chord guide opened over the canvas, took the stroke's pointerup (the stroke
  was never saved), and the next tool letter was read as a destination.
* On a map, the letters of the board-only tools (R, P, M, T...) still picked
  those hidden tools, and I still pressed the hidden picture button.
* Escape inside a text box or sticky was stopped with every other key, so
  the caret stayed in the box and the next tool letter was typed into it.

These read the source because the behaviour lives in two listeners on
`document` in two files, and what has to hold is the handoff between them.
