"""The validators (CHAT_PLAN "The deterministic foundation", decisions 52 to
54): one set of checks over every answer, the engine's and the model's alike.
The model proposes, the engine decides; a check here only ever reads strings
and parts, so it cannot itself make anything up.

- `source_check`: every number and name in an answer is in what it drew on
  (`ai/source_check.py`, the agent's H2 check, read here for chat too).
- `grounding_marks`: how much of the answer the notebook backs
  (`grounding.support`), with the sentences it does not.
- `maxims`: Grice's maxims as lints over a composed answer's parts
  (decision 52), each finding named by its maxim:
  quantity  a quote or a measured value said twice in one answer;
  quality   a number in the app's own joining words (only quotes, measured
            values, the asked words and computed sentences carry numbers);
  relation  a quoted sentence whose note is not in the grounding rows;
  manner    a capital after a joining comma, a title cut through a word,
            an exclamation mark or "Oops", a doubled space or stop, a
            sentence of the app's own words over forty words.
- `computed_rule`: a computed sentence only in a utility answer, never mixed
  into a claim about the notes, and always saying how the question was read
  ("Read as", or for a sum the expression it worked out; decision 54).
- `slots_missing`: the slots an act needs that a reading did not fill, so
  the act asks one question rather than guessing (decisions 48 and 50).

`report(result, question, notes)` runs all of them on a composed answer;
`check_model_answer(answer, sources, grounding)` on a model's.
`tests/test_validate.py` holds the measures: the maxims lint is 0 over the
showcase and voice evals.
