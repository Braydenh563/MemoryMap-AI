// search.js: the search box, "Find anything" (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN decision 46,
// phase 25a, Brief 47). One box over every kind the index holds (notes,
// documents, boards, mind maps, files, bookmarks, reminders and chats), the
// operators in its '?' help, saved searches as rows in the Notes sidebar,
// and the keyboard alone: arrows walk, Enter opens, Escape closes.
//
// Lazy (app.js `LAZY_MODULES.search`, fetched a few seconds after boot or
// on first use; `openFinder` is its stand-in until then). The engine is the
// server's (`GET /search`, search/engine.py); this file reads no query
// itself: the operators are `search/query.py`'s (tests/test_one_reader.py).
// Moved whole out of spaces-find.js, where it was boot code.
//
//: **One search over everything you keep, and over the app itself.**
//:
//: INBOX 270, the owner: *"this is a search for any and all content, items,
//: text, files everything. a full application wide semantic search which shows
//: content as well as features and actions etc. absolutely everything and what
//: shows can be filtered, sorted and toggled."*
//:
//: The engine was already here and nothing called it. `/search`
//: (routes_search.py over `search/engine.py`) ranks notes, documents, boards,
//: files, bookmarks and reminders in one list, keyword and meaning together,
//: with three scores, a plain-English explanation per hit and a count per kind
//: so an empty result can say whether nothing matched or nothing of that kind
//: is indexed. Measured against a live server before any of this was written:
//: a three-note, one-document notebook answers `?q=sourdough` with all four,
//: correctly ranked. The only reader of anything under `/search` in the whole
//: frontend was Settings, asking for a number.
//:
//: So this file is a front door, not a second search. What it adds on top of
//: the route is the half the route cannot have: the app's own actions. A
//: person looking for "dark mode" or "tensions" is searching, and a search
//: that answers only with documents sends them to the settings tree to hunt.
//: `paletteCommands()` is the existing list, so a command added there appears
//: here without anyone remembering this exists.

//: One icon per kind, the same glyph that kind wears everywhere else, plus
//: "action", which is this surface's own and is not a kind the index knows.
