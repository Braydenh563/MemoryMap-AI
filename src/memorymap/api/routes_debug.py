"""`GET /debug/health`, observability that costs nothing (PLAN.md B9).

Every number here already exists somewhere: `routes_tasks.collect()` already
builds the running-jobs list, `taskhistory` already remembers how each job
ended, `logbuffer` already tails the app log. This route is deliberately not
a new subsystem, just a single cheap read across the ones that exist,
because the thing being asked for is a page that answers "is this notebook
okay" in one glance: a support-bundle-sized diagnostic would defeat that.

**The <20ms budget is the whole design constraint.** Every count below is a
`COUNT(*)` filtered only by an indexed `workspace_id` (`WorkspaceMixin`
gives every one of these tables that index), nothing here does the thing
`support_bundle` can afford to (`entries_deleted`, `entries_private`, a
second query per flag): those extra WHERE clauses are still full scans of
the same rows without a matching composite index, and irrelevant to "is
this notebook alive", so they were deliberately left out of this endpoint
and left in that one, which has no latency budget at all.
