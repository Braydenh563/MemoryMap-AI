"""A focus ring is never cut off by the container it sits in (INBOX 685).

The owner, with a screenshot of the Dashboard constellation's Regenerate
button whose focus ring was cut along its left edge: "a lot of borders get cut
off on an edge."

A ring is an outline outside the control's box (2px line, 2px offset, so
`--ring-room`: 4px). An ancestor with `overflow` other than visible, `contain:
paint` or a `clip-path` paints nothing outside its padding box, so a control
flush against that edge loses the side of its ring, and nothing reports it:
the declaration applies, the element is focused, and a piece of the ring is
simply not painted. Only a measurement sees it, which is what
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/clip685.js` does (every focusable on every surface, its
ring's outer box against every clipping ancestor, 1440 and 390, both themes).

The fix is by container, in one place (08-consistency.css, "Ring room"), in
one of two recipes, never by hiding the ring:

- **room**: the container leaves `--ring-room` for the ring, as padding with
  the same negative margin (it scrolls) or `overflow-clip-margin` (it clips);
- **inset**: its children fill it edge to edge, so the ring is drawn inside
  the control with `outline-offset: -2px`.

This lint holds the list of containers the sweep found, so a later edit that
drops the room (a cleanup of "redundant" padding, a rewrite of the strip)
fails here rather than being found by the next screenshot. A container the
sweep finds later is added to `RING_ROOM` in the same commit as its fix: the
sweep is the proof, this is the ratchet.
