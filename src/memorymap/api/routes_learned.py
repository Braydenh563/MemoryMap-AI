"""What the notebook learned, over HTTP (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I7).

One writer and one reader over `ai/learning.py`. The write exists because
three of the four correction kinds happen in the browser and nowhere else: a
dismissed link suggestion, a result opened after a question, a resurfacing
card sent away. The fourth, a re-file, is already recorded server-side by
`entry/manager.update_entry_with_correction`, which is why there is no
"refile" caller here.

I9, the derived facts and their lifecycle, is the second half of this module
(below the corrections routes). It needs a view of what the app worked out
rather than of the corrections themselves, which is why it has its own store
(`ai/facts.py`) and why the two halves sit under one prefix: from the outside
they are one answer to "what has this app decided about my notes".
