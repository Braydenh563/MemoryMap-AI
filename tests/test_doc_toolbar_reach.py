"""Every formatting tool can be reached, at every width and in focus mode
(INBOX 426 a and b).

The owner: "in the documents full screen mode, I cant access the formatting
toolbar or any of the other key tools or controls", with a screenshot of the
strip in its one-row mode at about 1000px: a horizontal scrollbar under the
buttons, and the strip's own pinned cluster (the layout, line-number and
collapse buttons, `position: sticky` on an opaque ground) drawn on top of
Insert, so Insert was cut in half and nothing past it could be seen. Focus
mode, for its part, hid the strip, the dock and the status bar outright and
offered no way back to any of them but leaving the mode.

And "the suggestions panel doesnt adapt properly to the sidebar and it also
needs to be accessible in full screen mode": in the right-docked 320px column
the panel's head was a `flex: none` row of five buttons, so the head ran
past the panel, the Dictionary button was cut off and the panel scrolled
sideways; in focus mode the only way to open it (the status bar's chip) was
hidden.

These lints hold the shapes that fix both. The geometry itself (every
button's rect inside the strip's and no two overlapping, at 360, 768, 1024,
1280 and 1600) is measured by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/doctoolbarfit.js`, which
the suite cannot run.
