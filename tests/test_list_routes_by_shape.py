"""A GET that returns a list, or a dict holding one, takes a `limit` or says why not.

Audit 2026-10-05, ARCH-13: `tests/test_list_endpoints_page.py` keys on a
function named `list_*`, so it never saw `/graph`, `/entries/link-suggestions`,
`/documents/outline` or `/entries/query`. This lint keys on what a route
returns instead: a `list[...]` response (its annotation or `response_model`),
or a `return {...}` whose values include a list built in the route (a
comprehension, `list(...)`, `sorted(...)`, `.all()`, `_to_out_bulk`). Such a
route takes a `limit` query parameter, or is named below with the reason its
size does not grow with the notebook. A row marked **open** grows with the
notebook and has no page yet: the list of those may only shrink.
