"""The document outline is not rebuilt when no heading changed (INBOX 424).

`renderDocOutline` runs on every pause in the typing. Rebuilding every row
and re-marking the current one (two forced layouts in
`keepOutlineRowInView`) cost 515ms of a 40-character burst at 4x CPU in a
16-heading document; with the rows kept it is 12ms. The key has to hold
everything a row is drawn from, or a renamed heading would keep its old row.
