"""The composed answer, measured over the showcase notebook (INBOX 725).

The owner, 2026-10-06: "I want it soooo good it is almost like a chat bot".
The rule that does not move with it: every factual clause is the notes' own
words or a value the app measured (`tests/_composer_eval.py` says how each
measure is taken). These gates hold the composer to the numbers it reached,
so a later change that reads worse, repeats itself or loses a grounded clause
fails here rather than in the owner's hands.
