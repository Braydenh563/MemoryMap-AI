"""The act registry (CHAT_PLAN "The deterministic foundation", module 3,
decision 53): every act the app does from a sentence, each with `parse`,
`preview`, `run`, its `inverse` and a help line, over `ai/commands.py`, which
keeps the grammar, the cards and the tool door.

Every surface that names what an act does reads it from here: the capability
line said with no model, the palette's act rows, the Guide's act topics
(`help_topics_more.py`), and the line Ask says when a sentence is an act. A
model's proposed act (`propose`) is checked against the registry and goes
through the same preview, Confirm and Undo as a typed one: the model
proposes, the engine decides.

`inverse` names the step Undo runs; the run returns it (`run(...)["undo"]`)
and the page puts it on the app-wide undo stack (`pushUndo`, WORLD_CLASS
decision 53), so Ctrl+Z after an act takes it back.
`tests/test_acts.py` runs every write act and then its inverse on a real
notebook and checks the notebook is as it was.
