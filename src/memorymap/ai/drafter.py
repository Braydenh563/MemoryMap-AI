"""Turn loose thoughts into a written note, and keep revising it.

The shape of the interaction matters more than the prompt here. You write
whatever is in your head, the model turns it into a draft, and then it's a
conversation: you edit the draft directly, or add more thoughts, and the model
folds the new material in *without* undoing your edits.

That last part is the whole trick. A naive implementation regenerates from the
thoughts each time, which silently throws away every correction the user made
- so the draft the model is revising is always sent back to it, and it's told
in as many words that the user's wording wins.
