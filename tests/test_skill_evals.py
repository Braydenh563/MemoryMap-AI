"""CHAT_PLAN Phase 4's evals (Brief 13's done-when), against a real model.

Two measurements, both `evals` and skipped without one:

* **The loose-ends fixture**: seventy notes with eight planted loose ends
  (`tests/fixtures/chat/loose_ends.json`), "Find loose ends" run as the app
  runs it, and every planted one named in the answer, by its id or its
  anchor word.
* **Zero invalid calls over the built-in skills**: every built-in run under
  small-model mode; at least 80% finish with no step stalled or failed, and
  no run makes a call the harness refused for its arguments or its name.
  `MEMORYMAP_EVALS_SKILLS` (comma separated names) narrows the set, for a
  machine where a full pass takes hours.

A fake transport calls whatever its script says, so either number measured
against one would be a measurement of the script (Brief 13, "Left" 1): these
need `MEMORYMAP_EVALS_URL` and `MEMORYMAP_EVALS_MODEL`, read here at import
exactly as `tests/test_skills_evals.py` reads them. The fixture's own shape
is checked without a model, so the module always collects a test.
