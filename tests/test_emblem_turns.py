"""The app's emblem turns wherever it is drawn (INBOX 426 h).

The owner: "all of the animated logos arent rotating and the one form the
new chat interface is missing". Measured with the system's reduced-motion
hint on (Windows' "Animation effects" off is the common way to have it):
every emblem carried `animation-name: emblem-spin` and its transform did not
move between two samples 500ms apart, on the lock screen, the dashboard's
hero, the top bar's mark and the chat's welcome. And at 1280x720 the chat's
welcome hid its emblem outright (`.chat-empty.is-short`).

The turn itself was never removed. `canvas.emblem-spin` restates its
duration and iteration count under the hint with `:root` and `!important`,
which beat the vestibular blanket in 02-chat-graph.css for as long as that
blanket was a bare `*` (specificity 0,0,0). Commit 08f874d exempted the
companion from the blanket with `*:not(:is(#nm-buddy, ...))`, and a `:not()`
or `:is()` takes the specificity of its most specific argument: the id
raised the whole blanket to 1,0,0, so from then on it beat every
`!important` exemption in the app, the emblem's included, and each one ran
its 43.6s turn in 0.01ms and stopped. The same blanket also stopped the
progress indicators that escape it the same way.

These lints hold the three halves: the blanket stays at no specificity, every
drawn emblem is asked to turn, and the chat's welcome keeps its emblem when
the pane is short.
