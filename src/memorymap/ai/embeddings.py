        no separate opt-in, so installing the one PyPI package that makes
        it importable at all is the same "works without being asked" shape,
        not a new consent-requiring action the way turning on web search or
        checking GitHub for updates would be.

        Deliberately narrow: only a genuine "the package flat-out isn't
        there" `ModuleNotFoundError` triggers this. A different failure: 
        a corrupted install, an incompatible wheel, an out-of-memory crash
        - retrying the exact same `pip install` would do nothing but burn
        bandwidth and hide a real problem behind "installing…" forever;
        `is_installed`'s own docstring already notes that import-success
        isn't "it's sound", which is a different, harder problem than this
        (`reinstall`, the manual escape hatch in Settings, exists for that
        one). Reuses `core.extras.start`, the same machinery the Settings ->
        Packages button calls: including this session's `find_system_python`
        fix, so this now actually works on a packaged (frozen) build, not
        just a source checkout.
