"""The lists are served in index order, in the view people are in (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 19.3).

The `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` pass of 2026-10-05 (`scratchpad/plat1005_query_plans.py`,
every GET route over a 5,000-note notebook) found that every composite index
built for a list led with `workspace_id`, and that the page's default view,
All spaces, never sends an equality on it. So the notes list, the bin, the
archive, the Timeline, the Library's activity, uploads, documents, chats and
reminders all sorted their whole table on every page. `database._INDEXES` now
carries the same orders without the space column; this asserts each list's
own statement, as the route really runs it, is planned without a sort.

It also holds the trap the first cut fell into: an index that leads with a
flag SQLite takes for a selective equality (`is_deleted = 0`, `archived_at IS
NULL`) turns "every live note, by id" from a table read in rowid order into an
index lookup plus a sort. The last test pins those statements to the plan
they had.

SQLite plans these without statistics (nothing runs `ANALYZE`), so the plan
does not depend on how many rows the test seeds; a few dozen is enough.
