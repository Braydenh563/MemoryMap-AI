"""The small visual carry-overs in wrapup-0927.md (10c, 10, 8), measured in Chromium.

Each test pins the shape of the fix; the numbers are in the ledger entry.

* 10c(1): an escaped select list is at least its trigger's width. Before,
  ten of thirteen were narrower (Library "Items per page" 131.5px under a
  215.6px trigger); after, every list measured is its trigger's width or
  wider.
* 10c(2): a chip's leading icon sat 1.5px above the chip's centre (a flex
  child ignores `vertical-align`); nudged 0.1em down.
* 10c(3): the Web panel's "..." waited for the engine status call.
* 10(d): a note card's meta row sat 6.4px under its text, 8px under "Show more".
