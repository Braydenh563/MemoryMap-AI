"""A question asked from a suggested follow-up says where it came from (INBOX 490).

The owner: "I feel like there should be hyperlinked bread crumbs or a file tree
sort of thing for if a suggested follow suggested question is used." Chat
draws a trail of the questions a follow-up chain came from above the question,
each a link that scrolls to its turn and lights it; Ask draws the same trail
above its answer, each crumb opening that earlier answer in place. Driven in
Chromium by the session's `trail490.js`; this is the server half (the link is
saved with the turn, so the trail survives reopening the chat) and the cheap
half of the client.
