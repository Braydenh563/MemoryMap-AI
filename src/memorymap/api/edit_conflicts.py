"""Two windows, one note: the optimistic check on a save (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 22.1 item 5).

Every read of a note or a document carries `content_hash`, the hash of the
text it shows. An editor that saves sends back the hash of the text it
started from as `base_hash`; if the text on the server is no longer that
text (another window, another device on the LAN or the agent saved in
between), the save is refused with 409 and the text that is there, so the
editor can offer "keep mine", "take theirs" or "compare" instead of the
later save silently overwriting the earlier one.

The text, not `updated_at`, because `Entry.updated_at` moves on every
write to the row (a pin, the AI filing the note, a link resolved) and each
of those would read as a conflict with the person typing. Two saves of the
same text are not a conflict either: nothing would be lost.

A save that sends no `base_hash` is not checked, so every writer that does
not edit from an open copy (the agent's tools, undo, a restore, a checkbox
ticked on a card) behaves exactly as before.
