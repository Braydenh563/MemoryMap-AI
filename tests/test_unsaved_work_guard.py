"""The unsaved-work guard (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 22.1 item 4, navigation.js).

"No `beforeunload` guard anywhere; the drafts cover the capture box, but a
document mid-save, a board mid-drag and a chat mid-stream are not checked."
This covers the three surfaces named in the brief whose "has this been
saved yet" is a plain flag already read by their own Save button rather
than something that needs asking a server: the note edit form
(`noteFormDirty`, notes-list.js), the Capture box (`#entry-content`'s own
value) and a document mid-autosave (`docDirty`, documents.js). One reader
of each flag (`hasUnsavedWork`), never a second writer, and one
`beforeunload` listener for all three rather than the old `docDirty`-only
one that used to live in documents.js.
