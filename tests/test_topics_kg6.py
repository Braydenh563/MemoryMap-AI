"""Topics inside an island, named (GRAPH_PLAN KG6, INBOX 528).

`paths.clusters` stays what it was decided to be: connected components,
exactly true. A big component is often two or three subjects joined by one
bridge, and a reader wants those named. `entry/topics.py` finds them by
weighted label propagation (an edge counts more when its two notes share
neighbours, so a lone bridge cannot pull one subject into another) and names
each by the tags, entities and title words its notes share more than the
notebook does.
