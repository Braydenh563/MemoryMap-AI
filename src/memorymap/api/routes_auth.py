# frontend sets explicitly, so a browser never attaches it to a cross-site

# pasted an image address into; on localhost a nuisance, on a LAN a leak.
#
# Now unlocking sets a cookie instead, and three properties do the work:
#
#   HttpOnly: no script on the page can read it, so an injected one cannot

#   SameSite=Strict: another site cannot make the browser send it, so an
#             `<img>` on a page elsewhere pointing here loads nothing.
#   Path=/media and Path=/files: the browser sends it to those two prefixes

    `/change-password` deliberately does NOT do this, see crypto.py's own

    changes, on purpose, so an ordinary password change can't touch a single
    note. That is the right trade for that endpoint, but it leaves exactly
    one long-lived secret in this app that nothing ever rotates: the key
    that actually encrypts every private note. If an old wrapped-DEK ever
    got out: a stolen backup made before a password change, a copied
    database file: it still opens *today's* notes, because they are still
    under the very same DEK the backup was wrapped around. This endpoint is
    the fix for that: generate a new DEK and move every note onto it, so an
    old exposure stops mattering.

    All-or-nothing, deliberately paranoid (this is the HIGH RISK direction
    CLAUDE.md calls out for this exact feature): every note is decrypted
    with the OLD key and re-encrypted with the NEW one entirely in memory
    first; nothing is written to the database, and the in-memory key is not
    swapped, until every note round-trips cleanly under the new key AND the

# --- forgot your password? (INBOX 663) --------------------------------------
#
# Three routes. `/recovery-key` makes or replaces the key from Settings (or
# the step after setup), behind the lock and the current password. The other
# two are the lock screen's "Forgot your password?" card, and so are open:
# whoever calls them has, by definition, no password. What stands in for it:
#
# - **This computer only.** `_from_this_computer`: a loopback connection, no
#   forwarding header, a loopback Host (the DNS-rebinding door). A phone on
#   the network is told to do it at the computer the notebook lives on; a
#   reset is a change to the notebook's own files and belongs at its keyboard,
#   where the terminal command already was. The Origin check (core/security.py)
#   still stands in front, so another site's page cannot fire them either.
# - `/recover` needs the recovery key, and wrong keys earn the same waits as
#   wrong passwords (the same buckets: a guess is a guess).
# - `/reset` needs the word RESET typed, which only stops an accident; the
#   person at this keyboard could always run the terminal command.
#
# Nothing either says depends on the notebook's contents: no note counts, no
# "this notebook has no recovery key". A missing key and a wrong one are the
# same 401, so a passer-by learns nothing by trying.
