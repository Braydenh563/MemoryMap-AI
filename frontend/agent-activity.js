// Agent Activity: a list of runs, not a log. Moved out of app.js on
// 2026-09-26 (INBOX 426 cc, and the gzipped-size ratchet in
// tests/test_static_compression.py). A classic script loaded right after
// app.js: it shares app.js's globals, and everything app.js calls in here
// (addAgentRun, endAgentRun, agentRunStep...) is called from inside a
// function, never while app.js itself is loading.

// --- Agent Activity: a list of runs, not a log -------------------------------
//
// Reported, verbatim: *"make a better way to view and access agent model
// activity and logs that appear in the agent activity toast panels then how
// they appear now, they just spawn in and its a bunch of text dump in your
// face and just gets annoying. it should still be accessible though."*
//
// What it was: a live tail of every log record from `memorymap.*`, opened by
// the arrival of a line. One agent turn writes its context budget, its prompt
// composition and its tool budget, three paragraphs of arithmetic, so the
// panel's whole content was machinery nobody asked to read, and it opened
// itself to show it.
//
// What it is (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM.md, Phase C): **one row per run**, collapsed.
// Opening a row shows its steps; opening a step shows the tool calls it made
// and what they returned. Three levels, each collapsed until asked for, and
// deliberately the *same* `<details>` shape and CSS the chat transcript uses
// for Thinking (`agent-step step-thinking`) and for a skill's plan
// (`agent-step step-plan`), so this is that component in another place rather
// than a fourth thing to maintain.
//
// The log is not gone and is not summarised: it is behind "Show log", with the
// same lines it always had. That is the "it should still be accessible though"
// half, and it is why `appendAgentLog` below is unchanged apart from no longer
// forcing the panel open.
