"""The graph's first visible frame is drawn at the fitted zoom (INBOX 738).

The owner: "the graph always loads in really zoomed in before it rights itself
with the fitted zoom". Measured on 60 notes (scratchpad/ui-sweeps/
graphfirstframe.js, every animation frame's zoom and the canvas opacity):
the first visible frame was at k 1.21, the worst at k 2.5 (the fit's clamp),
against a settled fit of 0.79, and 104 visible frames were more than 10% off
it. Three causes, three fixes, checked here:

- the first fit read `x`/`y`, which were still the starting spiral until the
  next paint's glide; it now snaps the glide first (`gcGlideFinish`);
- the first fit glided from the default camera over 500 ms while the canvas
  was fading in; it is applied at once while the canvas is hidden;
- one tick out of the spiral is not the map's shape: a fresh layout is
  stepped in the worker, unposted, until it is as cool as the settle fit
  wants or a budget is spent (`WARM_MS`).

After: first visible frame k 0.785 against 0.788, no frame 10% off. The arc
(k 0.31) started at k 1 for a frame; `frameTree` is instant from the default
camera too.
