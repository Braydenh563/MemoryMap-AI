"""Nothing in the browser calls a function that does not exist.

This exists because of a real, total outage that every other check in this
suite waved through. An outside change ran a regex over `whiteboard.js` to
move the board's undo history onto the app's stack; the pattern was lazy
across two hundred lines, so it deleted `WB_KIND_INFO` (26 call sites),
`wbItemTransform` (14), `wbBeginTextEdit` (9) and six more functions along
with the two it meant to replace. `wbItemTransform` is what positions every
card on the board, so the whiteboard threw a `ReferenceError` on its first
render and drew nothing at all. `node --check` passed. `ruff` passed. Every
lint in this directory passed. Nothing in `tests/` opens a browser, so the
suite passed too.

A `ReferenceError` is the one class of frontend defect that can be found
without running anything, because the app's files are classic scripts
sharing one global scope (index.html loads them in order, and the surface
bundles are fetched into that same scope later). So the union of every
declaration across `frontend/*.js` is the namespace, and a bare `name(`
that resolves nowhere in it is a crash waiting for whoever opens that
screen.

Deliberately narrow, to stay at zero false alarms:

* **Call sites only.** `foo(` counts, a bare mention of `foo` does not,
  except for SCREAMING_SNAKE constants, which are distinctive enough to
  check on sight and are how `WB_KIND_INFO` would have been caught.
* **Bare names only.** `thing.foo(` is a property, and whether it exists is
  a question about an object this file cannot see.
* Declarations are collected from anywhere, not just the top level. A
  function nested three deep still proves the name is not a typo, and
  proving *reachability* is a different, much harder question than the one
  this file answers.

A hit here is real. Fix the call or restore the definition; adding the name
to `KNOWN_GLOBALS` is only right when it genuinely comes from the browser
or from `frontend/vendor/`.
