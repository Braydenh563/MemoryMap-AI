"""The Guide finds the right help topic for the way people actually ask.

INBOX 406, the owner: "improve the answers and accuracy of responses when no
ai model is available". With no model the Guide answers from `HELP_TOPICS`
alone, so which topic a question reaches *is* the answer. Measured on
`fixtures/help_questions.json` (122 questions with typos, synonyms and plain
phrasing): the keyword-count rule it replaced reached the right topic first
for 49% and nothing at all for 20%; the ranked rule reaches it first for 99%
and within the top three for all of them. INBOX 410 added 55 questions about
each surface's keys, controls and hidden features (177 in all): 99.4% first,
100% within three. The bar below is lower than the
number so a new topic can shift one question without a false alarm, and high
enough that a regression in the rule cannot hide.
