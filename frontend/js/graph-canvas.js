// MemoryMap AI: the graph, drawn to a Canvas 2D surface.
//
// GRAPH_PLAN.md §4 ("Renderer: Canvas 2D first") and §5 Phase 1. This is the
// other half of `graph-worker.js`: the worker decides where the notes are,
// this paints them, and neither one touches the DOM per node.
//
// **Why this exists at all** (§2.1, measured before it was written): the SVG
// renderer builds one `<g>` per node with a circle, a halo, a shine and a
// label, plus two `<line>`s per edge, and rewrites every one of their
// attributes through d3's selection API on every tick. At a few hundred notes
// that is thousands of DOM attribute writes per frame on the same thread the
// pointer is being handled on, which is why dragging stuttered. Here a frame
// is a few hundred canvas path operations regardless of how many notes there
// are, and the simulation is not even on this thread.
//
// It is loaded as a classic script *after* graph.js and before app.js, so
// `renderGraph()` in graph.js can dispatch to `renderGraphCanvas()` by name at
// call time. Nothing in app.js's own top-level wiring names anything in here.
//
// What is deliberately shared with graph.js rather than re-implemented: the
// note popup, the new-note form, the link panel, trace, the minimap, saved
// views, keyboard driving, `fitGraphToView` and the tree/radial/arc layout
// maths. Those are all renderer-agnostic, they work on `graphNodesRef` and on
// `graphSvg`/`graphZoom`, and this file points those at the canvas.

// --- the drawing surface ------------------------------------------------------

//: **One surface, not a pile of module globals** (GRAPH_PLAN Phase 4, the
//: local pane). Everything the renderer needs to draw one graph into one
//: canvas lives on an object made here, and every function below is handed
//: the one it is working on. It used to be forty-odd module-level `let`s,
//: which is fine while there is exactly one canvas and impossible the moment
//: there are two: the pane beside a note and the tab would have written each
//: other's node array, transform, worker and hover state. `s = gcTab` as the
//: last parameter everywhere means the tab's own calls, and the sweeps',
//: read exactly as they did.
//:
//: `size` says which of the two this is. "full" is the tab: it owns the
//: chrome (the legend, the minimap, the stats line, the time slider, trace,
//: the keyboard) and writes the renderer-agnostic globals in graph.js that
//: the chrome reads. "pane" is the small one beside a note: same draw, same
//: worker, no chrome, and it touches none of those globals.

//: look slightly nicer, cooler, more professional and more modern. visually".
//:
//: Every node is already drawn with a halo 6px outside its core, and until now
//: the only thing hovering one changed was a ring around it. The dot now grows
//: out to that halo and the halo steps a little further out and brightens, so
//: the glow stays a glow around the node rather than something the node has
//: swallowed.
//:
//: **Animated here rather than in CSS.** The SVG renderer could do this with a
//: `:hover` rule; this one paints to a canvas, which has no elements to hover
//: and no transitions. So the eased value is held as one number and the draw
//: loop is asked for frames only while it is moving: `gcHoverFrom`/`gcHoverTo`
//: name the node it is leaving and the node it is entering, and both are
//: eased, so moving the pointer straight from one node to the next shrinks the
//: first while the second grows instead of snapping.
//:
//: The cost is bounded by construction: at most two nodes are ever mid-ease,
//: the animation is 140ms, and when nothing is easing `gcHoverEase` is exactly
//: 1 and no frames are requested at all.
//: **Toned down after the first version was shown.** The owner: "the halo
//: growth on the nodes is a bit visually jarring tbh". It was the full 6, so
//: the smallest nodes jumped 67% wider in 140ms while their halo pushed out
//: another 3 and brightened by half again: three things moving at once, and
//: the smaller the node the louder it read. Half the distance, half the light
//: and a little longer to travel it keeps the gesture (the node comes forward
//: under the pointer) without the pop.
//: **A node is a sprite, not three arcs.** The owner on the flat discs with
//: a halo ring: "the visual part of the main graph design needs a better
//: look", and on a first attempt with a highlight dot: "makes it look like a
//: bowling ball". So: one soft radial fill per node (a little lighter at the
//: centre, the category colour at the edge, no dot), a one-pixel rim a shade
//: darker than the fill so the disc has an edge against any background, and
//: a glow outside it that is wide and faint for a hub and narrow for a leaf.
//: Drawn once per colour and size into an offscreen canvas at the current
//: zoom and pixel ratio, then `drawImage`d, which is what keeps a
//: two-thousand-node map inside the frame budget: a radial gradient per node
//: per frame would not be.
