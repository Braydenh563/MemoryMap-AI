// chat-agent.js: following a stream, the agent's run timeline, the writing
// room. Moved out of app.js on 2026-09-26 as one contiguous range (INBOX 426
// cc, docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/appjs-split.md). A classic script sharing
// app.js's globals, loaded in app.js's old order; nothing in an earlier file
// calls into it while the page loads (scratchpad/appjs-map.js --check).

// --- following a stream without fighting the reader -------------------------------
//
// Asked for directly: the chat and the thinking box should scroll themselves
// as the model writes, "but if the user tries to scroll up it will release the
// lock". Both halves matter: a pane that does not follow makes a long answer
// look frozen, and one that follows unconditionally yanks you back to the
// bottom the moment you try to read what scrolled past.
//
// No "is this scroll programmatic?" flag is needed, which is the usual way
// this gets complicated. Distance from the bottom answers it on its own: a
// scroll we caused lands at zero and stays stuck, and a scroll the reader
// caused moves away from zero and unsticks. Scrolling back down re-sticks,
// so getting the follow behaviour back is the obvious gesture rather than a
// button.

//: while a turn is live, and falls back to a plain jump-to-latest the rest of

//:
//: The backend reads these from the tool's own result rather than from the
//: arguments it was called with, so this row says what happened rather than
//: what the model asked for. Chips open the note, like every other note chip
//: in this app; nothing renders when a call touched nothing.
// Notes and documents share an id space only by accident, id 12 is a
// different object in each table, so the chip has to carry the kind the
// backend decided (`_touched_kind`) and route on it. Clicking a document
// chip through `flashEntry` would open an unrelated note, or nothing.

  //: `touched` channel every other tool uses, so a map becomes a chip in the
  //: line that already exists. `preview: false` because a map's preview is a

//: and the panel it opens is the card, with that kind's real actions under
//: it. `toolTouchedRow` is now a thin adapter onto this, so an old saved
//: transcript (which has only `touched`) renders through exactly one code
//: path, not a fork that ages differently.
