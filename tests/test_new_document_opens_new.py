"""New document makes a new document, and that is the one left open (found
by the e2e suite, tests-e2e/specs/documents.spec.js, 2026-10-05).

Library, Create, New document on a session that had not opened Documents
yet opened the last document instead: the row switched tabs and pressed
`#doc-new` 160 ms later, before documents.js (fetched on the tab's first
visit) had bound that button, so nothing was made, and the tab's own loader
opened `docs[0]`. A person then typed a title and text into an existing
document believing it was new: measured in the browser, the seeded
"Sourdough method" was renamed and appended to, and no document was made.

Two fixes, each pinned here:

* the row waits for the tab (and so its code) and then makes the document
  itself, no timer;
* `openDocument` answers only its newest call: the tab's loader opening the
  last document and the new one opening race, and whichever fetch landed last
  used to win.
