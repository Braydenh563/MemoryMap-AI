"""A folder import reads only inside home and the data folder (§12, S3).

`POST /import/directory` takes a filesystem path from the request body and
walks it. For the one person at their own machine that is the Obsidian
import; for anyone holding a token over a network it was a read of any
directory the server can see. So the resolved folder must sit inside the
user's home or the notebook's data folder, and every file the walk reaches
must resolve inside the folder that was chosen: a symlink out of it (a file
or a whole directory) is skipped, not followed.
