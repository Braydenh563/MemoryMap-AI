"""How the composer reads a question's shape (`composer.classify`).

The 2026-10-10 triage: the Gemini branch added "translate", "convert",
"utility", "summary", "math" and "reading_time" shapes ahead of the rest, and
the translate pattern matched any "to <word>", so "How long is the train from
Lisbon to Porto?" and "Who are we looking to hire?" were answered as requests
to translate. Those shapes are gone (a sum is `arithmetic`'s, before any
shape is read); this pins every showcase question (`tests/_composer_eval.py`)
to the shape main gave it, so a pattern added ahead of the others cannot
steal a question again without failing here.
