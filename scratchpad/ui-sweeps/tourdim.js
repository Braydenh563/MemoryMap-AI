// The tour's dim covers the whole window, including the scrollbar gutter.
//
// The owner, twice, with screenshots: "I pressed next after starting the tour
// and then the popup dissapeared and everything dimmed except for a small
// strip on the right", and again after trying it in a browser rather than the
// desktop app, which ruled out a stale cache.
//
// The four dim panels are `position: fixed`, so they are laid out against the
// window, but they were sized from `document.documentElement.clientWidth`,
// which stops at the scrollbar. The gutter was left uncovered: a bright band
// at the right edge, the full height of the window.
//
// **Headless Chromium cannot see this on its own**: it draws overlay
// scrollbars that take no space, so clientWidth and innerWidth agree and the
// gutter is 0. That is why every earlier sweep of this surface passed. So this
// probe forces a classic scrollbar, which is what Windows gives, and then
// measures that nothing is left uncovered.
//
// **And the first two versions of this probe measured the wrong thing**, which
// is why the owner reported it a third time ("the whole tour is completely and
// utterly broken", 2026-09-21). The four panels were transparent: the dim was
// `.tour-spot`'s own `box-shadow`, spread 100vmax, and a rectangle check over
// the panels could not see it at all. The panels now paint the dim
// (04-chat-dock-appearance.css), so the rectangle check below is finally a
// check of the dim, and the pixel pass after it proves the rectangles and the
// paint agree. The second pass also catches what no rectangle can: the step
// card was a translucent `.card`, and the dashboard clock read straight
// through the step's own text.
