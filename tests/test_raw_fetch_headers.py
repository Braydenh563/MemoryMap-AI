"""Every hand-rolled `fetch()` to a locked route carries the auth header.

`api()`/`apiJson()` (app.js) add `X-Auth-Token` to everything they send. A
few calls cannot go through them (a streaming body, a multipart upload, an
event stream) and are written as a bare `fetch()`, and each of those has to
add the header itself. Two forgot, months apart, and both failed the same
quiet way: a locked app answered 401, the caller fell back to something that
worked, and the feature was reported as "broken" while its tests were green
(`/chat/stream` lost the space header; `/help/ask/stream` never sent the
token, so the Guide never streamed on a locked notebook).

The lint reads the source, since the suite cannot log a browser in: a
`fetch(` whose first argument is an app path must name `X-Auth-Token` within
the call. Routes served before login are listed, not exempted by shape.
