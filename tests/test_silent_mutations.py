"""A write that fails says so (audit 2026-10-05, FE-12).

`.catch(() => {})` on a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE hides a person's own
action failing: Forget a memory, delete a backup, pin or delete a question,
clear the server log, the tension card's "Linked as contradicting." shown
when the POST had failed, a bulk reminder delete. Each named one now toasts
the reason and stops before any success message.

The rest are not all wrong (a beacon, a best-effort preference write, a
background mark-as-read), so this is a ratchet rather than a ban: the number
of writes with a silent catch can only go down. A new write that may fail
quietly on purpose says why in a comment and is counted here.
