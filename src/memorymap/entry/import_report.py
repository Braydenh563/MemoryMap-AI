"""The import report (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 25b, Brief 48): what one import read,
wrote, skipped and merged, with every skipped item named and why.

Before this the whole record of an import was a status line and a toast,
and a skip past the second was "Left out 14: a; b." with the other twelve
gone. A report is kept as a small JSON file in `<data>/import-reports/`, so
it outlives the toast and a restart: the last `KEEP` stay, the oldest go.
The status line when the import ends and the Activity panel's finished line
open it (`GET /import/reports/{id}`).
