"""`box.readOnly = true` on a note box reaches the editor mounted over it.

The Write with AI desk sets `#draft-text.readOnly` while a pass streams into
the draft (`setDraftBusy`, chat-agent.js). Once the note-surface editor has
mounted, the textarea is a hidden mirror and the flag lived only on it: a
person could type into the draft while it was arriving. Measured in Chromium
with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/draftreadonly.js` (typing during the pass changed
the draft; contenteditable stayed true). The fix is a compartment driven by an
own `readOnly` accessor, the same hook `value` uses; script writes still go
through, so the stream itself is not blocked.
