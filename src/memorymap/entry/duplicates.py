"""Find notes that say the same thing twice.

A notebook you actually use accumulates near-duplicates: the same thought
captured on two days, a note re-typed because the first one was hard to find,
a shopping list rewritten rather than edited.

Detection here is deliberately arithmetic rather than AI, normalise the text
and compare word overlap. That means it works with nothing running, it's
instant, and it's explainable: the score is a percentage of shared words, not
a black box. The AI's job comes later and is optional, at merge time, where
judgement genuinely helps.
