"""The Timeline's "On this day" range (TIMELINE_PLAN section 8: Day One's
"On this day", the cheap Phase 4 addition).

`GET /timeline?on=MM-DD&tz=<minutes east of UTC>` keeps what was written on
that calendar day in an earlier month or year, in the reader's own day, and
leaves today out: the same rule as the Dashboard's On this day widget, so the
two can never disagree. Server side, because a client-side filter over a paged
feed would only find last year's page once someone had scrolled to it.
