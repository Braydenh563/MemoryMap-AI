// The guided tour: one card at a time, anchored to the control it describes.
//
// The app already had a welcome (`#onboarding-overlay`, app.js): a card in the
// middle of the screen with an icon, a title and a paragraph. It says what
// MemoryMap is, and it is the right shape for that, but it cannot say WHERE
// anything is, because it covers the thing it is talking about. That gap is
// what this file fills, and the owner named it: "there is no guided tour and
// introduction, with positioned popup cards with back, next, skip, card
// tutorial tour numbers 1/?, dimmed background".
//
// Three rules shape everything below:
//
// 1. **A step is a real element plus a sentence.** No step invents a picture
//    of a control; it names a selector, and if that selector is missing or
//    hidden right now the step is dropped rather than pointed at nothing.
//    That is what makes the tour survive a narrow window, a control that
//    moved, and every later change to the markup: a step whose element has
//    gone simply stops being shown, and the counter renumbers.
// 2. **Short, and in sections.** The owner: "the tour cant be too long
//    because I dont want users skipping it or finding it too hard and giving
//    up". A section is three to five cards and counts its own ("Graph, 2 of
//    4"), and at its last card the tour offers the next section by name or a
//    Finish, so every section is a place to stop and none is a place to get
//    lost. The first run starts at "The basics" and chains on from there;
//    Settings, help and guide starts at any section and chains on the same
//    way (the owner, 2026-09-23: the other sections had to be found in
//    Settings one at a time). TOUR_SECTIONS is the one place that knows what
//    a section is: the replay buttons are built from it, so a section added
//    to that table needs no markup and no handler.
// 3. **It never traps anybody.** Skip is on every card, Escape does the same
//    thing, the choice is remembered beside `onboardingDone`, and nothing
//    here ever opens itself again once it has been finished or skipped.

// The geometry, in CSS pixels. These are window coordinates rather than
// design tokens: they are arguments to `getBoundingClientRect` arithmetic,
// which is why they live here and not in the stylesheet.
const TOUR_GAP = 12; // between the highlighted control and the card
const TOUR_EDGE = 12; // the closest the card may come to the window's edge
const TOUR_PAD = 6; // how far the bright cut-out is held off the control

// The sections, in the order the whole tour plays them. Each step is:
//
//   target  a CSS selector for the real element the card points at
//   side    where the card would like to sit; it flips and clamps if it
//           cannot fit there, and never covers the element
//   title   three or four words
//   text    one sentence, sentence case, no exclamation marks
//   tab     the tab that has to be showing for the target to be visible
//   notes   the Notes sub-tab ("capture", "browse", "writing-room", "ask")
//           the target lives in
//   or      a second selector, used when `target` is not on screen at this
//           window size because the control has moved behind another one
//           (on a phone Settings and Timeline live in More)
//   orText  what the card says when it is pointing at `or` instead, which
//           has to say where the control went, or the card describes a gear
//           while lighting up a button labelled More
//   library a Library sub-tab (its `data-target`) to press first
//   wb      where the Boards & maps sub-tab has to be: "landing" (the list of
//           boards), "board" or "map" (the newest one of that kind, opened;
//           the tour never makes one, see `tourContext`)
//   settings  the Settings section to open; the modal stays open between
//           two steps that both name one, and closes for any other step
//   need    a name in TOUR_NEEDS: the step is kept only when that is true
//           of this notebook when its section starts (a card's menu needs a
//           card, a map's controls need a map)
//   media   a media query the window must match for the step to be in the
//           run at all, for a control that only exists on one side of a
//           breakpoint (the chat list is a sidebar on a laptop and a button
//           in the dock on a phone)
//
//: **Every main feature has a section, and a section walks INTO it** (the
//: owner, 2026-09-23: "If I want to do the other sections of the tour, I have
//: to go into the help settings and click the other tour section buttons, and
//: they dont guide me through the other main features"). The old four
//: sections pointed at the Graph, Timeline and Library *tab buttons* and said
//: what was behind them; each section here opens the feature and points at
//: three to five of its own controls, one sentence each. They are played one
//: after the other: the last card of a section offers the next one by name,
//: so no run ever needs Settings to find the rest.
