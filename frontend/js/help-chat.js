// opens from the status bar, the Settings Help row and Ctrl+Shift+H). Moved out
// of settings.js on 2026-10-05 to leave the boot (tests/test_boot_budget.py):
// nothing here runs until someone asks Atlas something. Loaded by
// `LAZY_MODULES.helpChat` (app.js), whose stand-ins for `openHelpChat`,
// `askAtlas` and `renderAtlasStarters` fetch it and call the real ones. The
// chat's markup is parked in `#atlas-host`, reachable only through
// `openHelpChat`, so its handlers are bound here, when it arrives. The Guide's
// names (`GUIDE_NAME` and the rest) stay in settings.js: the status bar reads
