"""A board's pictures are written into its export, not named by address.

The export SVG referenced each picture by its `/media/...` url. An SVG drawn
through `<img>` (`wbRasterizeSvg`) loads nothing outside itself, so every PNG,
PDF and library copy of a board had a blank where its pictures were; measured
in Chromium by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbexportimage.js` (the pixel in the middle
of a red picture read the board's white before, red after). The saved .svg
pointed at an address that means nothing outside the app. Both now go through
`wbInlineSvgImages`.
