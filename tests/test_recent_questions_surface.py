"""Which turns "Ask again" offers back (routes_chat.py's `/chat/recent`).

Reported directly: *"tasks that I have put in the agent show in the 'ask'
again section, the things that I will ask the agent are different to what I
would ask if searching in my notebook."* Every turn used to write the same
`queried`/`chat` audit row, so an instruction the agent had already carried
out came back as a chip inviting you to run it again.

The rule the report gave, in the user's words: *"if I was in the chat and
using the 'ask' mode, then those queries should count, but only those, and my
previous requests in the 'ask' subtab in notes should be registered."*
