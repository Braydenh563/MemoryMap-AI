"""One bounded pool for the background work an upload starts.

**The finding this replaces** (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN A3, and section 4's B2 in
smaller form): every upload spawned up to three `threading.Thread`s of its
own, plus a document read, and nothing anywhere counted them. Fourteen
`Thread(` sites, no semaphore, no queue, no pool. A folder of 200 pictures
was therefore 600 threads, all of them arriving at one Tesseract binary and
one local model at the same moment, and the failure it produces is not a
crash: it is a machine that stops answering while every job makes a little
progress, plus 200 SQLAlchemy sessions opened at once against one SQLite
file. Unbounded concurrency against a single-threaded resource is slower
than a queue, not faster.

**Two lanes, not one queue and not a lane per kind.** The two resources
behave differently enough that one width is wrong for both:

- `cpu`: Tesseract and the document extractors. Real parallelism helps, up
  to the core count, and past four the returns stop mattering on the kind of
  machine this app runs on while the memory does not.
- `model`: every call into the local model (captions, vision OCR, the
  entry filer). **One worker, deliberately.** A local model serves one
  request at a time; two concurrent calls interleave into one slower pair,
  and on a small machine the second load can fail outright for memory.

A kind nobody mapped lands on the default lane rather than vanishing, which
is the failure mode a `KeyError` here would have: a caption that is silently
never taken.

**Durable since B2** (`core/jobstore.py`): a job whose kind has a named
handler there and whose arguments are plain data is also written to the
`jobs` table when it is queued, leased when a worker takes it, and closed
when it ends. What follows about dropping still holds for this process's
memory; the row is what the next launch reads to run it again.

**Why jobs are dropped at shutdown rather than drained.** `shutdown` has a
deadline because a shutdown that waits is the hang it exists to prevent
(`core/bgtasks.py`'s docstring makes the same argument for cancellation).
Nothing here is lost by dropping it: every job re-derives its result from a
row that is already committed, so the next launch can redo it, and a caption
that never arrives is a missing caption rather than a corrupt notebook. The
job in flight is not interrupted, for the same reason `bgtasks` never kills a
thread: Python cannot do it safely and the work writes to a notebook the
user cares about. Workers are daemons, so the process still exits on time;
`shutdown` returns False to say plainly that one was still running.

**The activity panel needs no new frontend.** `pending()` returns rows in
`/tasks`'s shape (`routes_tasks.collect`), so queued and running jobs appear
in the panel that already lists the readings `core/filejobs.py` announces.
