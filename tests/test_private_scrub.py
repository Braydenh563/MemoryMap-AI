"""A private note's words are gone from the file, not only from the answers.

SEC-03 (security audit, 2026-10-05): making a note private removed its
search rows logically (`MATCH` found nothing), but FTS5 only writes delete
markers; the segment blobs kept every token until an automerge happened to
rewrite them. So the vocabulary of a private note (a PIN, a place) was
readable with `strings` from the live database, every `POST /backups` copy
and the `GET /export/backup` zip. The repro's own tokens are used here.
