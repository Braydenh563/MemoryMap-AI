"""WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D6: the calendar strip and the day pair in a daily note's head.

The backend (`/entries/daily`, `/entries/daily/{day}`) and Ctrl+D were built

cannot open a browser, so the shapes that would silently break are pinned
statically and `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/daystrip.js` drives the real thing.
