"""The guided tour follows what it points at, reaches folded settings and
says when there is no mind map (INBOX 426 y, images 87, 95, 96).

Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/tourfollow.js`: with content growing
above the companion step's control (no scroll, no resize), the old tour left
its ring 180px off the control; now 0. `tourfirst.js` walks basics into Notes
and the Settings section at 1184 to 1600 wide: the card covers its control in
no 50ms sample from the moment it shows, and the companion step (in the
closed "Atlas and faces" fold on a fresh notebook, so dropped from every run
before) is shown. `tourmaps.js`: with no map the maps section is one card that
says so.
