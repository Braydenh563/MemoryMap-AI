"""The margin reader (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I2; 18, H8): a second reader in the
editor, from the person's own notes.

`POST /editor/read` takes one paragraph and returns at most three typed
cards: `repeats`, `contradicts`, `answers`, `date`, `related`. Without a model
it answers from the notebook alone (keyword and meaning search, the open
questions, the date reader); with `judge` and a model it asks the model for
the relation. Nothing is ever written into the text.
