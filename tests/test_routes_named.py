"""Every route has a test naming its path (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 26.2, decision 59): a ratchet.

The route table is read from the real app (so `include_router` prefixes are
counted, which a regex over the route files misses). A route is named when
some string literal in `tests/` has the same segments: a `{param}` segment in
the route matches anything, and a hole (`{eid}`, `%s`) in the test's literal
matches only a route's own `{param}` segment, so `/entries/{eid}` does not
name `/entries/export`. A literal ending in `/` is a prefix with one
segment to come (`"/documents/" + id`). Methods are not compared: the rule
is the path, which is what the decision says.

The seed began as the 49 routes found on 2026-10-10 and is now empty: every
route is named. A route no test names fails; add a test that calls the path,
or delete the route.
