"""Nothing new reaches the network without somebody deciding it may.

WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 12, S5: "move the private-IP guard into
`core/security.py` as `assert_public_url()` and call it from every outbound
fetch (bookmarks, clipper, update downloader, provider base URL)". The move is
done; this is the half that keeps it done, and it is the shape
`test_every_route_is_locked.py` already uses for the same reason: a new
outbound fetch added tomorrow reads exactly like one that was reviewed.

The rule is not "every fetch calls the guard". Most of the modules below are
*supposed* to reach an address the person set or the app installed, a local
model or a local SearXNG among them, and asserting the guard there would be
asserting the wrong thing. The rule is
that the list of modules that reach the network at all is short, written down,
and carries a sentence per line saying which kind each is. A module that turns
up here without a line is the finding.
