"""Filing by the notebook's own words, with no model at all (INBOX 434).

The owner: notes must file "amazing even when the ai isn't available or
accessible and then even better with it". Before this, with no chat model
and no embedding model loaded, every new note went to Uncategorised: the
log line said "the keyword fallback", and there was no keyword fallback.

This is that fallback, and it is a real one. It learns from what the person
has already done:

* every filed note is a labelled example of its category (its words and its
  tags, a tag counting as three words because it is a deliberate label);
* a note the person filed or moved by hand counts twice, because that is the
  strongest statement anyone made about where a note belongs;
* a category's own name, said in the note, is evidence for it ("gym: 5x5
  squats" belongs in Gym whatever else it says).

It is nearest neighbours by shared rare words (TF-IDF cosine): the closest
notes vote for their categories by how close they are, the classical answer
for short text with few examples. No training step, exact to recompute, a
thousand-note notebook in milliseconds. It abstains rather than guesses: a
category needs two notes to be chosen, and the winner must hold most of the
vote with two notes (or its own name) behind it, or the note stays in
Uncategorised with nothing pretending to have decided. A wrong category is
worse than none, because a note filed wrongly is a note the person cannot
find. Measured on a hand-written 100-note, ten-category notebook
(`scratchpad/filing_eval.py`, leave one out): right 80% of the times it
files, filing 15% of notes that share little vocabulary on purpose; a real
notebook repeats its own words more than that one does.

Not used when a model answered: the chain in `janitor.categorise` is the model
first (when there is one), then filing by meaning, then this.
