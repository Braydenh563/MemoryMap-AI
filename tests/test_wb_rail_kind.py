"""INBOX 657, the owner: "I cant select on any of the other left sidebar
subtabs on the mindmap other than the library". A map reached from the board
picker (or made by New board) kept the board's rail, Notes, Layers and Pages,
and `wbOpenSidebar` sends each of those back to Library on a map. The rail's
kind is now set in `fetchWhiteboardState`, the one fetch every way onto a
board goes through. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/maprail657.js`: 4 FAIL before,
PASS after, from the picker and from `openWhiteboardBoard`."""
