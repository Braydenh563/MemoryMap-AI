"""A map whose notes are all filtered out says so, and offers them back.

The graph had one empty state, "Nothing to map yet: save a few notes and link
some together", and it drew it for two different facts: a notebook with no
notes, and a notebook whose every note is hidden by the map's own filters (the
legend's categories or rule keys, a group switched off, notes hidden from the
node menu, or "Hide unlinked" on a notebook with no links). The second is a
claim about the person's notes that is false, and its one button (Capture a
note) does nothing for them. Found 2026-09-26, measured in
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphemptyfilter.js`.

The suite cannot open the map, so this holds the shape as text: the markup has
a second variant with its own action, the renderer chooses between them on
whether the data had notes, and the action clears every filter that can take
a note off the map.
