// atlas-life.js: Atlas's living tail, its rings' loops and its props' own
// motion (INBOX 623). The tail and the rings moved out of
// atlas.js on 2026-10-05 (the boot-script gzip budget, tests/test_boot_budget.py):
// the figure draws whole without either, its tail in its drawn shape and its
// rings at rest, so nothing here is needed for the first frame. Loaded by
// `LAZY_MODULES.atlasLife` (app.js) when a layered figure is first made
// (`atlasFigure`, which then calls `atlasRigLowerAttach`, `atlasRingLoops`,
// `atlasPropLoops` and `atlasTailAttach`); the lower body's pose for the
// state (`atlasRigLower`) came with them the same day, for the same budget;
// `atlasTailWake` stays in atlas.js, since the rig calls it on every wake and
// a figure only has a tail to wake once this file has attached one.

//: The rings' and the planets' loops for a figure, as Web Animations (the
//: boot stylesheets are at their budget): each ring's sway, shared by its
//: two halves and its planets' frame so they stay one ring; its dust's
//: turn, the next ring the other way; each planet's glow and swirl. Every
//: one starts at a random point of its own clock. Paused and played with
//: the tail's loop (`atlasTailFrame`), which knows when the figure is off
//: screen, hidden or still by setting.

//: **A living tail** (INBOX 601, the owner: "make it smooth and biological.
//: also add more movement and variation to the tail position, behaviour,
//: movement"). Before, the tail was one fixed drawing turned a degree or
//: three about its root by CSS loops, with its tip half turned about a
//: joint a beat behind (`tailWave`): a stiff flame swinging, every cycle
//: the same. Now its centreline bends along its whole length, every frame,
//: as a spine does: the rest centreline sampled at `ATLAS_TAIL_N` points,
//: each step between them turned by the angle the tail has bent through
//: by then (`atlasTailBend`), so the root never moves, the bend grows
//: toward the tip and the outline stays one smooth tapered stem (the same
//: `atlasStem` and widths the drawing has). The angle is a curl along the
//: length (the tail held up, held down, wrapped round) plus a wave that
//: travels from root to tip, and a second, slower one out of step with it.
//: What it does is a behaviour, `ATLAS_TAIL_ACTS`: a lazy sway, a curl
//: (its tip up like a question), a wrap (round toward its feet), a flick
//: (a quick ripple, a second and a half), a wag (pleased), a trail (on the
//: move), a droop (low, asleep) and a stiff hold (startled). The state the
//: rig reads (`atlasLowerState`) picks one by weight (`ATLAS_TAIL_BY_STATE`)
//: and holds it 4 to 9 seconds at random, never the same twice running, so
//: it never repeats; every number eases to the next on a critically damped
//: spring and the wave's phase is carried across a change of speed, so no
//: change is a jump. A slow drift on two clocks that never line up (11.3s,
//: 17.9s) bends it a little more or less all the time. It draws 30 times
//: a second while the figure is on screen and motion is on; off screen,
//: on a hidden tab, with Avatar animation off or under Reduce motion, it
//: rests in its drawn shape and costs nothing. It is the tail's own layer

//: **Here, ten times a second, not a CSS animation.** It is inside the body's

//: about a tenth of a pixel even at 2.2 times, so it reads as the same
//: breath. By the clock, not by frames, so a slow machine does not step it
//: more often than that. It rides the tail's loop, which already knows when the
//: figure is off screen, on a hidden tab, or still by setting (Avatar

//: the chest back at rest then.

//: On the rise's clock: the swell takes its phase from the box's own
