"""Focus mode can open and close the documents sidebar (INBOX 453 (1)).

The owner: "there should be a way to open and close the documents editor
sidebar when in full screen mode". The sidebar is one of the bands the mode
hides; the floating dock's Sidebar toggle brings it back as a panel fixed to
the window's left edge while the page gives up that room, the mirror of the
Suggestions panel on the right. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/docfocussidebar.js`
measures the geometry; these lints hold the shapes.
