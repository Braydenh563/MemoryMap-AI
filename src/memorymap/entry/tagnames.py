"""The one rule for what a list of tags may hold.

Its own module, with no imports from the app, because two layers need the
same rule and neither may import the other: `api/schemas.py` (every HTTP
write of tags) and `entry/manager.py` (every in-process write: the AI tools,
the librarian, imports, renames). A rule kept in two copies is how this bug
happened in the first place: the schema already dropped blanks while the
manager and the tag rename did not, so a blank tag still reached four notes
through `POST /tags/rename`.
