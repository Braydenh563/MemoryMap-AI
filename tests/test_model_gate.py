"""Interactive model calls go first (audit 2026-10-05, ARCH-09, ARCH-16).

A local runner serves one request at a time, and background work (captions,
vision reading, filing jobs, the night and entity passes) started its next
call whenever it was ready, so a chat turn asked during an import waited
behind as many calls as reached the runner first. Background work now
yields between its calls while a chat turn is streaming; the follow-up
suggestions are not asked for while the person is already asking again.
