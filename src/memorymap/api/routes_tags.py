"""Tag manager endpoints: see, rename, merge and delete tags across notes, and
add or remove tags on a chosen set of notes.

Every write here is one transaction, records a revision and an `edited` event
per note it touched (the way `PUT /entries/{id}` does, so each note's history
shows it), and answers with `before`: the tags each changed note had, which is
what `POST /tags/restore` takes to undo it in one transaction too."""
