"""A note's details line is one line (INBOX 455 (1)).

The owner: "note metadata wraps now and needs a better redesign and
structure. also I think the note date should be consistent in where it is on
the notes." Measured at 1100 before (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/notemeta.js`, ten
seeded cards): six lines wrapped and the time sat on a line of its own on
some cards and beside the facts on others. The line is `nowrap` now; tags and
suggestions that do not fit fold into one "+N" chip, then the word facts keep
only their icon, then ellipsise; the time is always the line's last fact.
The browser half (no wrap at 1440, 1100, 820 and 390, one date x per width)
is the sweep's; this holds the shape so it cannot drift back.
