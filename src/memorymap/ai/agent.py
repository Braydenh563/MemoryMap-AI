"""The agent loop: the chat model can act on the notebook.

Flow: offer the tool registry to Ollama → run whatever it calls → feed
the results back → repeat (bounded) → its final text is the answer.

Safety lives here and in tools.py: destructive calls are never executed

# What the model is handed before a single word of the question, the notes or
# the history, the system prompt plus every tool schema, resent on each of
# up to MAX_ROUNDS rounds.
#
# This is the number that decides whether the agent is usable on the 3B-class
# models people actually run here (granite4.1:3b, llama3.2:3b, qwen3.5:2b).
# Ollama defaults to a 4096-token window unless a model says otherwise, so at
# ~4 chars per token this overhead alone can be most of it, and everything
# past the limit is silently dropped from the *front*, which is the system
# prompt, so a model that overflows stops knowing it has tools at all.
#
# It is asserted rather than noted because it drifts upward invisibly: every
# tool added and every sentence added to the guide costs the same budget, and
# nothing else in the codebase would notice. When this needs raising, raise it
# deliberately and say why here.
#
# 13,000 → 13,800, for the four category tools (§14). The guard did its job:
# adding them took the all-tools overhead straight past the old figure, and
# the first version of those schemas, with a per-parameter description on
# each, matching the older tools, went past the *window* too. They were
# rewritten terse (no "old: the current name" when the field is called `old`)
# and now cost 1,112 characters between them.
#
# **This is now a backstop, not the mechanism.** It was briefly the binding
# constraint on §14's tool list, "room for about one more tool, then none" , 
# which was the wrong shape of answer, because the ceiling it described was
# never a fact about the app. 4096 is what Ollama falls back to when a model
# declares nothing; most current models declare 8k, 32k or far more.
#
# `tools.within_budget` now fits the schemas to the window the model actually
# reports (`ollama_client.usable_context`), dropping the least relevant tools
# when they do not fit and logging what it held back. So a 32k model gets the
# whole registry, a genuine 3B at 4096 gets a prioritised subset, and adding a
# tool is no longer a question of whether it fits inside a constant.
#
# What this number still does is catch the *prose* growing, the system prompt
# and TOOLS_GUIDE are sent whatever the window, and no per-turn trimming
# applies to them. If it trips, look at what was added to the guide before
# reaching for the number.
#
# 13,800 → 14,400, for `ask_user` (§33). The guard did its job again, and the
# useful part was *how* it tripped: the registry was sitting at 13,743 of
# 13,800, so it would have fired on whoever added the next tool, whatever it
# was. The first version of the schema was 784 characters of prose explaining
# when to ask; it was cut to 507 by keeping only the two rules that stop it
# being misused (stop after asking, don't ask what you could look up) and
# deleting the rest. `ask_user` is in CORE_TOOLS, so unlike most tools it is
# paid for on every single turn, which is exactly why it had to be terse.
#
# 14,400 → 15,000, for `related_notes` (§9). Second raise in one session, and
# that pattern is worth naming rather than repeating silently: **this number
# was measuring the wrong thing.** It weighed the *whole* registry, and no turn
# has sent the whole registry since `within_budget` started fitting the schemas
# to the model's real window: a 4k model receives about 1,450 tokens of it, a
# 32k model receives all of it and has ample room. So what tripped was not "the
# prompt is too heavy for a small model" but "the registry grew again", which
# is a thing that is *supposed* to happen.
#
# **Retired at that point, exactly as the note above it said to.** It asked for
# retirement if it ever needed raising a third time for a *tool* rather than
# for prose: and the third time came in the same session, for one added
# argument on `save_skill`. A guard that has to be raised every time the app
# grows is not a guard; it is a chore that teaches people to edit the number.
#
# What replaces it is two assertions that each measure something real:
#
#   - `PROSE_BUDGET_CHARS` below: the persona and TOOLS_GUIDE, which are sent
#     whatever the window and are *never* trimmed. This is the half the old
#     constant measured honestly, and the half that can still quietly bloat.
#   - `test_prompt_budget.test_the_overhead_leaves_room_for_an_actual_
#     conversation`, what actually reaches a 4,096-token model *after* the
#     trim. That is the number that decides whether a 3B model works.
#
# The tool registry is deliberately no longer capped by a constant. It is
# capped by the model's real window, per turn, by code that is tested.

# The un-trimmable half. Every character here is resent on every round of every
# turn, before the question, the notes or the history, and unlike the tool
# schemas, nothing fits it to the window. If this trips, something was added to
# TOOLS_GUIDE or the persona; look there rather than at the number.
#: 3,000 until 2026-09-23, raised by the default persona's growth alone
#: (librarian.DEFAULT_PERSONA, the owner's ask for a character): nothing else
#: may spend it.

# mistyped note id.
#
# The error now travels with a recovery instruction. The wording is
# deliberately concrete about the *next call to make*, because "try something
# else" is exactly the advice a small model cannot act on.

# three others and unlinking a fourth, having called `related_notes` once.
#
# That turn got past the original net twice over, and both gaps are worth
# naming because they are the shape of the next one:
#
# 1. The pattern only knew the first person singular, "I linked". The model
#    wrote "**Linked Notes:** We connected your main Social Skills Guide to…"
#    and "we" matched nothing.
# 2. It asked one question of the whole turn, "did *any* write run?", so a
#    turn that legitimately linked one pair and then claimed four more passed
#    on the strength of the one that was real.
#
# So claims are matched *per action* and checked against the tools that
# actually ran. That is §33's "completion verifier" in its cheap form: no
# second model round, just what was said against what was called.
