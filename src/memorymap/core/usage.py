"""The local usage ledger (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN H9, row 27): which of the app's
features this person actually uses, counted on this computer only.

Never sent anywhere. Nothing in the app reports it, no route exposes it to
anything but the person's own signed-in page, and it holds names of
features and dates, never what was typed. It answers two questions the
person can see in Settings, General, What you use: which features have not
been used in ninety days (the first notebook that tells its owner which of
itself is dead weight), and which are used most (the command palette lists
those first).

**A file, not a table.** One small JSON file beside the database, written
atomically: the ledger is a few hundred counters read whole and written
whole, it needs no query, and a table would be a migration shared with every
other agent's branch for no gain. Deleting the file resets it, which Settings
offers as Clear.
