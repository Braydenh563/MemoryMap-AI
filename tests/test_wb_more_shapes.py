"""The owner, 2026-10-11: "can you add more shapes and more arrow options??"
(the Shapes flyout had line, arrow, square, circle, triangle and diamond).

Nine more shape tools sit in the flyout, each drawn in the dragged box and
stored as the library's `custom` shape with its text area, so a hexagon drawn
here and one placed from the library are the same thing. The browser half is
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbcolour-shapes.js`."""
