"""ROADMAP.md item 34: a lightweight entity/concept layer above notes.

Every edge in the graph before this connected two whole notes; there was no
node for "this person" or "this project" independent of any one note
mentioning them. Deliberately smaller than a full ontology (see ANALYSIS.md
§59's read of a sibling project's LLM-entity-extraction, which this borrows
the *idea* of, not the code): no entity-to-entity graph, no type system, a
single free-text name per entity, and membership (`EntityMention`) as the
only edge kind. Extraction is one `suggest_tags`-shaped completion call per
note, on the utility model, run a few notes at a time by the autonomous
background pass (`ai/autonomous.py`) when `auto_entities_enabled` is on.
