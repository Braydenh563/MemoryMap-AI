"""Forgetting the password: the one reset both doors share (INBOX 663).

There are two ways to reset without the password or a recovery key: the
terminal command (`python -m memorymap --reset-password`, `__main__`) and the
lock screen's "I don't have it" path (`POST /auth/reset`, routes_auth.py).
They must leave the notebook in the same state, so the work is here and both
call it; each door only does its own asking (a typed RESET at a prompt or in
a field) and its own telling.

What a reset keeps and what it loses, which both doors say before it runs:

- Ordinary notes, documents, boards, files and settings are not encrypted
  with the password. They are plain rows, and nothing here touches them.
- Private notes are. Their data key is wrapped by the password (and by a
  recovery key, if one was made), and this removes the wrap, so they stay
  sealed for good. A sealed backup still opens with its own password: that
  file has its own key, not this one.
- "Allow other devices on this network" goes off (SEC-01): a notebook
  without a password is never reachable from the network.
