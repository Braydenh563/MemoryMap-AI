"""Text from outside the conversation, fenced as quoted data.

INBOX 430, the owner's prompt-safety ask: "note text, file text, web pages
and tool results that reach the model are wrapped as quoted data with a
clear boundary, and the system prompt tells the model that text inside them
is never an instruction."

Every piece of text the model reads that nobody in this conversation typed
to it (a note's body, a file's text, a web page, a search snippet) is put
between one pair of markers:

    <<<data note>>>
    ...the text...
    <<<end data>>>

and the system prompts carry `FENCE_RULE`, one sentence saying that text
inside them is quoted material and never an instruction. The markers are
spelled so no ordinary writing produces them, and any copy of them inside
the text is defanged first (`_defang`), so a page cannot close its own
fence early and speak outside it.

**Defence in depth, not the defence** (the same words `read_url`'s own guard
uses). What stops a destructive call is in code: destructive tools always
park for the person's confirm, and after a turn has read something from
outside the notebook (a web page, a search result, a file) the tools that
reach out (`web_search`, `read_url`) park too (`agent._dispatch_call`), so
an instruction hidden in a page cannot send the notebook anywhere without a
person pressing a button.
