INBOX 431 (g), the owner: "make the graph really visually pleasing and
impressive with a mix of connected and non connected, some clusters some
webs, some connections have reasons and others dont etc. make sure all main
features are properly shown."

The earlier screenshots were taken over four seeds stacked on one data dir
(seed.js, seed-timeline.js, seed-readme.js, seed-boardrich.js), each written
for a sweep, and their notes did not belong to one person: "Plain note number
7" sat beside a recipe in the Notes shot. This writes one notebook a person
could have, in seven categories, and nothing else:

- 71 notes. Work and Travel are dense clusters (a hub or two, most notes
  linked to several others), Cooking a looser cluster, Reading a sparse web
  (a chain with a few cross threads), Health a small tree, Home mostly loose
  notes, and Ideas the bridges between them. About half the links carry a
  reason ("why these two"), the rest are plain, so the graph draws both kinds.
- Created dates spread over the last seven weeks (written straight into the
  database after the API made the notes: no route takes a creation date, and
  a notebook made in one second has a one-day timeline and a one-day streak).
- Reminders with priorities and repeats, three linked to their notes.
- Three documents, one long enough to show the editor.
- A board with cards, shapes holding text and labelled connectors (this
  week's two whiteboard features), and a mind map with tasks, a note behind a
  topic and numbered branches (this week's three map features).
- Saved chats, so Chat and the Library have history.

Everything goes through the same routes the app uses, so the search index,
the audit log and the link table are filled the way they are in use. Run it
once on an empty data dir; it refuses a notebook that already has notes.
