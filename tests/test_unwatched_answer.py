"""An answer that finishes behind a closed panel says so (the owner,
2026-09-23: "if an AI response is started in the popup agent or the Atlas
guide and the user closes the panel before it finishes, post a
notification ... clicking it reopens the panel on that answer").

Closing either panel never stopped the turn, so the answer was written into a
transcript nobody could see. These pin the three halves in the source: each
panel's end-of-turn posts through `noticeUnwatchedAnswer` only while it is
closed and not stopped, the notice's action is plain data (notifications live
in localStorage), and the bell's row knows what to do with it. The behaviour
itself is driven in a browser by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/unwatched.js`.
