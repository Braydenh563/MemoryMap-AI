"""Nothing in Settings scrolls sideways (INBOX 622).

The owner, with a screenshot of Settings, Tools it can use: "idk if this
navigation is the right way to go about it. should it be redesigned
better??" It was a strip of the pane's group heads in the pane's dock that
scrolled sideways, with a visible scrollbar and its last label clipped. The
decision: the groups are the sidebar's second level, nested under the pane
they belong to (two levels, as VS Code and Linear draw settings), a press
scrolls to the group and the group you are reading is tracked as you scroll;
on a phone the jump list gains the same groups. And no horizontal scroll
anywhere in Settings, held here.

The stylesheet half: no rule that reaches an element of the Settings dialog
lets it scroll on the x axis (`overflow-x: auto|scroll`, or a two-value
`overflow` whose first value is). The runtime half, every pane at 1440 and
390, is `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/settingsnav.js` ("nothing in Settings scrolls
sideways").
