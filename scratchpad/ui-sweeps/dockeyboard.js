// DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 6 item 3: "the first line of text is on screen with
// the keyboard open", the one line of that phase asserted without a keyboard.
//
// **What cannot be measured here, said first.** Headless Chromium raises no
// on-screen keyboard, and nothing in this sandbox can make it. `visualViewport`
// therefore never shrinks on its own, `env(keyboard-inset-height)` is 0, and no
// run here can tell you what a real phone does when a real keyboard opens.
//
// **What can be measured, and is.** Everything between the platform's report
// and the pixels: `initKeyboardInset` reads `visualViewport` and writes
// `--keyboard-inset`; three surfaces read that token (`.chat-dock` and
// `.doc-toolbar` in 07-whiteboard-misc.css, `.thumb-bar` in 09-editor.css);
// and the phone band's layout has to keep the first line of the document above
// whatever is left of the window. So this probe stubs `visualViewport.height`
// and fires the app's own listener, which exercises the whole chain from the
// number the platform would report down to the padding that lands. The only
// thing standing in for the keyboard is the number itself.
//
// A stub is worth saying out loud: `write()` is the app's real function, the
// listener is the app's real listener, and the token, the paddings and the
// geometry that come back are the browser's own. What is fake is 336, and on a
// phone 336 is what the platform would hand over.
