"""INBOX 445 (1): the Bookmarks, Contents and AI skills sub-tabs.

The DOM is not visible to this suite, so these pin the shapes the measured
sweeps depend on (`scratchpad` drivers in the session notes): the ARIA tree on
Contents, every page of the bookmark list, Undo on both deletes, and the
skills kind segment. A failure here means one of those was rebuilt away.
