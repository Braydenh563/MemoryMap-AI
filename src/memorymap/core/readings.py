"""Every reading of a file, in one shape (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 10, F10).

"Extracted text, captions and OCR live in three columns with three UIs. The
Files card shows one, hides one, and the search indexes some." Measured when
this was written: a file has up to five places its text can be, the
`caption`, `ocr_text` and `vision_ocr_text` columns on `attachments` and on
`media_uploads`, and per-page rows in `page_reads` for a document read page by
page; the search index read three of them for an attachment and two for an
upload, so an upload read by the vision model, and every page read in the OCR
workspace, could not be found by its words.

**One `readings` table, as a view.** `readings(source, source_id, kind, page,
text, model, ts)` is a SQLite view over those five places, created at startup
(`database.DatabaseManager`) and replaced whenever its definition changes. A
view rather than a table the writers move onto: the four extractors, the
caption editor and the page reader keep writing where they write, and a
derived table cannot drift from them, which a second copy kept in step by
hand eventually does. `source` is "attachment" or "upload", the vocabulary
`page_reads.kind` already uses; `kind` is "caption", "ocr", "vision" or
"page"; `page` is 0 for a reading of the whole file.

`for_file` is the one reader for a renderer (`GET /files/readings`), and
`text_of` is what the search index takes for a file's body, every kind.
