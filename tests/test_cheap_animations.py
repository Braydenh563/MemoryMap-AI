"""An animation may not move a layout property without saying why (INBOX 308).

The owner, verbatim: "I also think we need to make sure that all animations for
things are done the cheapest they can be to reduce cost in the browser and
devices. like using transform etc etc."

An animated `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin` or `padding` makes the
browser lay the page out again on every frame of the animation, on the frames
where it is least affordable: a boot, a scroll, a phone. `transform` and
`opacity` are handed to the compositor and cost no layout at all. The
difference is not theoretical, and this repository has the number: converting
the boot splash's progress bar from `width` to `transform: scaleX()` took one
2.4s crawl from 121 layouts to 0 (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/animcost.js`, which
re-measures it).

So this lint fails on a `transition` or a `@keyframes` rule that names one of
those properties, and passes it when the declaration carries a stated reason in
a `/* ... */` comment ending on the line above. The escape is a comment rather
than a list of blessed selectors kept here, because the reason has to be read
where the trade is made, and a list in a test file rots the moment the
stylesheet moves. There is exactly one such reason in the app today, at
`#phone-tab-dock`'s `transition: height` in `10-responsive.css`: a bar that
recedes from 57.59px to 44px really is a box changing size with content in it,
where `translateY` would take the bottom off a 44px touch target and `scaleY`
would squash the icons.

**`box-shadow` is deliberately not on the list**, and this is the place that
decision is written down so it is not remade. Ten transitions in
`frontend/css/` animate it, mostly the hover lift on buttons and cards. It
repaints, it does not relayout, it is the app's idiomatic hover treatment, and
the cheaper form (a pseudo-element carrying the shadow, animated on `opacity`)
costs an extra box on every one of those surfaces. A rule that fires on the
ordinary, correct thing is a rule people learn to suppress rather than obey, so
this one fires only where there is a real layout to avoid. If shadow repaints
ever show up in a measurement, the answer is that measurement and a plan entry,
not a widening of this rule.

Like the other frontend lints this cannot see the DOM. What runs against a real
browser is `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/animcost.js`, which counts the layouts an
animation actually forces.
