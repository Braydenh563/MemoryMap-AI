"""Write frontend/credits.json from docs/THIRD_PARTY.md.

Settings, Help, Credits lists every library the app is built on (the owner:
"we should reference all the vendored repos and libraries somewhere to give
them credit"). THIRD_PARTY.md is the one record, kept whole by
tests/test_vendor_manifest.py; this turns its tables into the list the page
reads, and tests/test_credits.py fails when the two disagree.
