"""Summarise a meeting note into decisions and action items, every line cited
(INBOX 644, decision 3).

`librarian.summarize_meeting` (the recorder's pass, §25) returns a block of
bullets nobody can check: a small model that invents "Sam will send the deck"
writes it in the same voice as one that read it. This pass asks for each line
together with the exact words of the note it came from, and **keeps a line
only when those words are really in the note** (the Ask citation rule: a
claim with no source in the notebook is not shown as if it had one). What was
dropped is counted, so the sheet can say "2 lines had no source and were left
out" rather than pretending the model found less.

The reply format is one line per item, pipe separated, because it is the
shape a 3B model keeps most reliably and a malformed line degrades into one
dropped item rather than a parse error for the whole reply.
