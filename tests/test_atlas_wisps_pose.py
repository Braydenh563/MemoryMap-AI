"""The feminine Atlas's astral wisps and tail, after INBOX 535's follow-ups.

Measured with scratchpad/ui-sweeps/atlaswisps.js (6x, animations stopped):
- the waist and tail wisps ignored the pose: lying down, the tail turns -42deg
  about the hips and the wisps stayed put, their offset from the tail's centre
  falling from 14.0 units standing to 7.6 (they floated beside the body); now
  the same 14.0 in every lying pose;
- on a light page the wisps were barely there: median contrast 1.13 against
  what is behind them, 90th percentile 1.40 (dark: 1.20, 3.25); now 1.33 and
  3.28;
- the body's edge glow stopped at the hips; the tail now carries it.
The masculine look is pixel-identical in six poses and both themes
(scratchpad/ui-sweeps/atlasstill.js).
