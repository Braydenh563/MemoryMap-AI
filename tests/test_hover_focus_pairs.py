"""A hover is declared with its keyboard twin (UI_MODERNISATION Phase 13
decision 15).

The design review measured 418 selectors with a `:hover` rule, 282 of them
with no focus rule, and a Tab walk found 110 controls whose look did not change
when focused: a keyboard user saw two thirds of the app without the feedback a
pointer gets. Brief 57 measured 462 hover selectors, 253 of them alone, and
gave each its twin in the same rule, so the two can never drift apart:

    .row:hover,
    .row:is(:focus-visible, :has(:focus-visible)) { ... }

`X:hover` matches X and every ancestor of the pointer, so the faithful twin is
X focused by the keyboard or holding such a focus (`:has(:focus-visible)`), a
row lighting when the button inside it is reached by Tab exactly as it does
when the pointer is over that button. Inside a `:has()`, which cannot nest,
the twin is `:focus-visible` alone. A separately declared focus rule for the
same selector also counts.

Exempt, by shape rather than by name: a field's `:hover:not(:focus)` (the
focused field has its own ring and edge), and a hover on a pseudo-element the
keyboard cannot reach (`::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb`, `::file-selector-button`).
