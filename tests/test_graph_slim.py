"""`/graph?slim=1`: the map's own payload without what every reader assumes.

GRAPH_PLAN "Still open after KG1 to KG9": at 5,000 notes `/graph` was 3.1 MB,
and the first visit after any change spent its time building and encoding
it. Measured on that notebook (`scratchpad/kg1005_graph_bench.py`), a third
of the bytes were values every note carries at its default (a null pin, a
null type, no parent, `false`, `[]`, an unreasoned link's three nulls) and
timestamps to the microsecond. The slim payload leaves those out and the map
(graph.js, `graphFill`) puts them back on arrival, so every reader after the
fetch sees the shape it always did. The dashboard asks for the same slim
payload (its widgets read only each link's two ends), so one cached build
after a change serves both. Without `slim` the payload is unchanged for
every other caller.
