"""A pattern that was quadratic in a long run of whitespace.

`followups._INLINE_SPLIT` (model output, split per line) let the regex engine
try every split of a whitespace run between adjacent `\\s` quantifiers or from
every position inside the run. (The second, `docexport._TABLE_RULE`, went with
the python-docx writer, Brief 42.) Measured before the rewrite, on 20,000
characters: see the numbers in the CHANGELOG line. The rewrites are linear and
must keep splitting and matching exactly as before.
