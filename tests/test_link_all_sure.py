"""The Suggested links head's "Link all above 70%" (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN item 92).

The control was already on the row (`linkSure`, the integration's own build);
what it lacked, and what the world-class branch's version (a749b9d) had, is
checked here: it asks first (it links many pairs at once), it counts the pairs
that actually linked rather than the ones it tried, a failed link leaves its row
where it was instead of marking it done, and the Links help line says it exists.
