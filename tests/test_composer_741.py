"""The composed answer names a note once, by its title, and speaks its content (INBOX 741).

The owner, 2026-10-06, verbatim: "rn the ask chat messages just say, ur note
starting with this says this. also ur not starting with this says this,
furthermore, ur note starting with this says this." Every sentence came in
under its note's opening words and "says:". Now the sentence comes first,
the note is named after it as a citation, once, by its heading or, with no
heading, by the day it was written; joiners are varied and never repeated.
