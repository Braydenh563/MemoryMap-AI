"""A toast fired from a phone sheet is drawn over it (GRAPH_PLAN, "Still open
after KG1 to KG9").

`openSheet` puts a sheet one layer above whatever it was opened from, so a
sheet opened from a menu (2550) or the table view (2400) is drawn at 2551 or
above, and `#toast-box` at 1050 was behind it: the confirmation of the thing
done in the sheet was never seen. Measured at 390x844 with
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/toastsheet.js` (`elementFromPoint` at the toast's
centre): covered when the opener sat at 1050 or higher.

The browser half is that script; this is the lint that keeps the number above
the highest layer a sheet can be opened from and below the boot splash.
