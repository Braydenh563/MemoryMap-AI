"""A private note's kept tag suggestions travel exactly like its tags.

Decision (2026-10-04): `Entry.suggested_tags` and `Entry.discarded_tags` are
handled the way `tags` are for a private note. Tags stay readable by decision
(`manager._seal_link_reasons`: "the link itself and the note's tags"), so a
suggestion may be shown wherever the tags are, and must be shown nowhere the
tags are not. The check is a comparison, not a list of places: a surface that
hides the tags (search, the graph, the model's context, a locked export) hides
the suggestions, and a surface that never carried a suggestion at all (every
one but the note itself) stays that way.
