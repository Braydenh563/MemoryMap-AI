"""Time travel over meaning (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I5, H8, row 23).

"What did I think about X in March?" answered from the notebook as it stood
then, and a note's claims then set against its claims now.

**What the past is made of.** `entry_revisions`: `record_revision` saves a
note's text *before* each change, stamped when the change was made. So the
text a note had at an instant `T` is the content of the first revision
stamped after `T`, or, when nothing was revised after `T`, the note as it is
now. A note created after `T` did not exist then. Three limits, said rather
than hidden:

* a note keeps its newest `manager.MAX_REVISIONS` revisions; when all of
  them are kept and `T` is older than the oldest, older edits may have been
  pruned, so the version is marked `exact=False`;
* a private note's revisions are ciphertext and a binned note is not
  searched today either, so neither is read here;
* edits coalesced into one revision (a burst of typing) are one step.

**No model, no new table** (the spec's "Data: no new table"): the claims of
then-and-now are the note's sentences (`grounding.split_sentences`), paired
by shared distinctive words; a model's judgement over the pairs is the
spec's optional second half and is not built. Retrieval as of a date takes
its candidates from the engine (today's notes) and from revisions whose
text matches the question, then ranks the then-texts by the same words.
