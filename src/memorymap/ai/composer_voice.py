"""The app's voice: the composer's remarks outside an answer.

Asked for by the owner, 2026-10-06 (CHAT_PLAN, "the composer everywhere"):
*"use the composer basically really good sentence model like an ai or apple's
siri really smartly to improve quality of life across the app ... like with
the companion message bubbles"*, with the north star *"soooo good that users
dont even need to install ai"*.

**One engine, one rule.** This is `composer.py`'s other half, not a second
writer: it reads notes with `composer.read_note`, quotes them through the same
`_Answer` (so every quote is a cited row with offsets), names days the way an
answer does, and keeps the rule that module states at its top. Every factual
clause of a remark is one of:

- a note's own sentence or list item, quoted (`quote`), or its name (`title`);
- a tag or category the note is filed under (`filed`);
- a reminder's own words (`reminder`);
- a word that each named note contains (`word`), for a pattern;
- a value the app measured (`measure`): a count, a day, a year.

Everything else comes from `VOICE`, a closed phrasebook that says nothing
about the world ("Still open in ", " is due today."). The tests hold every
part of every remark to that (`tests/test_composer_voice.py`), and the eval
(`tests/_voice_eval.py`) measures what the owner asked for: grounded, never
twice the same, short.

**Kept apart from `composer.py`** so the answer path (Ask and Chat, owned by
another session) and the voice can change without stepping on each other; the
shared machinery is imported, never copied.

Pure and deterministic: the same notes on the same day give the same remarks.
Wording varies by day and by note (`composer._pick` over a salt), so the same
note resurfacing next week is said differently.
