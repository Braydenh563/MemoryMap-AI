"""`scripts/gate.sh --staged` runs the lint set once, against the index.

It used to run the lint set twice back to back, first against the working tree
(the plain `lints` step) and then against a checkout of the index
(`staged-lints`), so a staged commit paid for the set twice: over twenty-five
minutes under load (OPEN.md, "Smaller backend and gate rows"). The working-tree
run adds nothing the staged one lacks, since both run the one `LINTS` array
over the same tracked files and the staged one reads what the commit will hold,
so under `--staged` it is skipped.

Three things are pinned, in a scratch repository with the real script and a
stand-in interpreter that logs every pytest call it is handed (the real lints
are the slow part, and what is under test is which tree they are run in):

1. with something staged, the lint set runs once, in a checkout of the index
   (it reads the staged file, not the one in the folder);
2. that one run is handed exactly the arguments a plain `gate.sh` hands its
   own, so nothing the working-tree run checked was lost;
3. with nothing staged there is no index to check, so the working tree is
   linted once instead: `--staged` never runs zero lints.
