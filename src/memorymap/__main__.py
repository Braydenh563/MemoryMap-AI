# Shown in the desktop window the instant it opens, before the server is
# reachable: replaces what used to be a black/blank window for however long
# _wait_for_server() took, which on a cold start (embeddings warmup, a slow
# machine) is not always instant. Someone running in "hidden console" mode
# (show_console_on_startup=False, or the packaged installer's console-less
# build) has *no* terminal to watch either, so this is the only feedback
# they get that anything is happening at all, reported directly: "the
# window doesn't [show] until all the checks and dependency updates are
# done", which is exactly the gap between this window opening and
# `_boot_and_swap` below finishing.
#
# Deliberately plain, inline HTML/CSS/JS rather than a page served from
# `frontend/`, the whole point is that it must render with no server
# listening on HOST:PORT yet, so it cannot be a request to that server. The
# palette (#4664f0) matches index.html's own `theme-color` meta tag rather
# than pulling in the real app's CSS, so the swap to the real window doesn't
# jar even though nothing is actually shared between them.
#
# The logo is the same reason, and is why it is **copied** here as inline SVG
# rather than referenced. Asked for directly ("add the logo to the loading
# screen"); this window used to show a 10px blue dot beside the wordmark,
# which is the first thing anyone sees of the app on a cold start. It cannot
# be `<img src="/favicon.svg">`, there is no server to serve it, and a
# `file://` path breaks in the packaged build, so the artwork is duplicated.
# It is 30 lines of static geometry that has changed once; keeping the two in
# sync by hand is cheaper than the alternatives, and a drift shows up
# immediately on the next launch.

    FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, the model manager and the embeddings module: 1.20s of
    the 1.21s it took to import this file at all, measured with `-X importtime`
    on a warm cache on Linux. Every one of those seconds was spent *before*
    `main()` had parsed a flag, so on `--desktop` it was spent before
    `webview.create_window` could put anything on screen. A packaged Windows
    build pays it worse: the imports come off disk through whatever is
    scanning them, and the person is looking at nothing at all, because that
    build has no console either ("the splash wasnt appearing on the packaged
    windows launcher").

    The desktop path does still need all of this, but it needs it on the
    server thread, which `_run_desktop` starts *after* the window is up. So
    the cost has not gone anywhere; it has moved behind the window it was
    delaying.

    **Why this exists, not verified against a real machine** (the owner,

    WebView2 (edgechromium), and the loader DLL this build already bundles
    (WebView2Loader.dll, visible in the packaging log) only talks to the
    system-wide WebView2 Runtime; it does not carry the runtime itself. Most
    Windows 10/11 machines have it as a Windows Update component, but a clean
    image, a minimal Windows Server, or an old LTSC build may not, and
    pywebview's failure mode when it is missing ranges from an exception this
    launcher never sees (the frozen build hides its console) to a legacy
    engine that cannot render the inline SVG mark or the flexbox layout
    `_LOADING_HTML` uses, which is exactly "the graphic doesn't show" with
    nothing in any log to say why.

    Detected the way Microsoft's own docs recommend: the Evergreen Runtime
    registers its version under this registry key, one of a 32-bit and a

        window still comes forward, the person asked for the app, and the
        honest answer is the lock screen, not nothing happening.

        "Reminders" specifically but asked to apply to "the others" too: a

        an open Settings modal, which is a full-screen overlay, the tab
        changes, nothing about it is visible, and clicking Reminders reads as
        broken. `switchTab()` itself has no opinion on a modal sitting on top
        of it; closing that modal first is this factory's job, applied once
