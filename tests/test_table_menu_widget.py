"""The live view's table menu survives its own press (INBOX 290).

The owner, 2026-09-21: "when I click on a header row in a table on the live
view in documents page, another row appears below it until I click off, and I
cant click the meatball button on the end of the row".

Measured before the fix with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/doctable290.js`: one press
on the kebab left `.cm-editor.cm-focused` gone, the widget unmounted, and the
`.action-menu` standing under the header row with no opener. Two causes, both
in `DocTableMenuWidget`:

* `openActionMenu` shows the popup, measures it and reparents it to `<body>`
  when it would be clipped. Those are mutations inside the widget, and a
  widget that does not claim them makes CodeMirror re-read the content DOM,
  which rebuilds the view and blurs the editor.
* The decoration that draws the menu is computed from `view.hasFocus`, so the
  blur then removed the button that had just been pressed.

Neither is visible to a test that cannot run a browser, so this file holds the
two shapes rather than the behaviour: the widget claims its mutations, and the
decoration has a second reason to draw the menu besides focus. The behaviour
itself is `doctable290.js`, 10 of 10.
