"""The privacy promise is the product, so it is held to the code.

This app's whole claim is that it runs on your machine and nothing goes out.
That claim is made to the person in several places, and it is enforced in
exactly one: whether a preference is on. Nothing kept the two in step, and on
2026-09-21 they had come apart.

**What was measured.** Three places told the person that web search is "the
ONE feature that goes online": `routes_settings.py`, `routes_websearch.py`'s
own 403, and the Tools and features row in `dashboard.js`. Two lines below the
first of them sat `update_check_enabled`, commented "The other opt-in network
call", and `routes_update.py` does `requests.get` against `api.github.com`.
Settings, About also said "Nothing ever leaves this computer", unqualified, in
the same panel that offers both switches.

Nothing was leaking: `llm_provider` defaults to `ollama`, the
OpenAI-compatible client defaults to `http://localhost:1234/v1`, and both
network features default to `False`, so a fresh install really does make no
outbound request. The behaviour was right and the sentence describing it was
wrong, which for a privacy-first app is its own kind of bug: the reader who
cares enough to check is the reader who stops trusting the rest.

So this test counts the opt-in network features in the code and fails when the
copy no longer matches. Add a third and it goes red until somebody has
rewritten the sentences and thought about whether the promise still holds.
