"""The rest of a map's own look (MINDMAP_PLAN.md §13e, decisions 8 and 9).

Three things the first half of the theme left open, each gated here:

- **a branch palette a person picks**, drawn in two places (the canvas and
  the Library thumbnail). Decision 8 asked that the two be one: the server's
  `MAP_BRANCH_PALETTES` is the only list, `/tree` hands the resolved colours
  to the canvas, and the thumbnail and its cache key read the same name;
- **a font for the whole map**, a map-level fact like the palette, so neither
  is ever written onto a topic's style on the way out to a file;
- **decision 9's narrow case**: a topic on a themed map can be pulled back to
  the app's own default for a field the map themes. Each such field has a
  stored name for its default (`MAP_APP_DEFAULT_PINS`), which beats the theme
  the way any value a topic carries does, and which an export writes as the
  absence it means.
