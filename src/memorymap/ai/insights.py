"""Patterns in the notes, measured, with a fixed hedge (CHAT_PLAN Phase 6,
decision 32): never a claim about the person, always a count over their own
notes, said with one tested phrase that fires only on its rule.

"You have written about golf 4 times since 5 September, three of them after
work; that may be a hobby forming." Every slot of every template is a count,
a date or the person's own words (`composer_tables.INSIGHT_TEMPLATES`; a lint
in `tests/test_insights.py` holds it), so the sentence is re-derived from the
notes by running the rule again, which is what the eval does.

The rules, each a function over the notes and their facts (`factgraph`):

- recurrence: a subject in at least 3 notes across at least 3 weeks;
- streak: a subject written about in at least 3 consecutive weeks;
- drift: a plan at least 30 days old with no later note on it;
- contrast: a preference, then a later one the other way about the same thing;
- load: a week with at least twice the median count of notes (and 4 or more);
- time of day: at least 3 of a subject's notes say "after work", "in the
  evening" or "before work", "in the morning".

Insights close a broad answer and make the Patterns line (Tidy and the
dashboard, `routes_insights`); they are never filed as facts on their own.

Confirm and Not right (decision 60). Every insight line carries both.
Confirm writes a fact the person vouched for (a `derived_facts` row of kind
"confirmed", model "you"), said from then on as their own word, never
re-hedged: "Golf is a hobby of yours (confirmed by you, 10 October)." Not
right records a "dismiss_insight" correction; that insight and its
near-variants (the same rule about the same subject, whatever the count or
the dates) are not shown again. `key` is what makes two lines variants.
