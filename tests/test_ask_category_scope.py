"""A question that names a category is answered from that category (found
driving a real model, 2026-10-05).

The app suggests "Summarise my notes in Health." itself (routes_chat.py's
suggested questions), and Ask answered it from whatever matched the words:
measured on the seeded notebook with Qwen2.5 1.5B, the summary of Health
cited "Notes as a map" (Ideas) and "A photo book of the trip" (Travel). The
same retrieval feeds the no-model answer, so it quoted the same strays. A
category the notebook has, named as where the notes are ("notes in Health",
"my Health notes"), now narrows the candidates to it.
