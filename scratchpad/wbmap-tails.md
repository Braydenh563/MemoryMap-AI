# Whiteboard and mind map tails, ranked (2026-10-04)

Ranked by what a person making boards and maps notices first, then cost
(S under an hour, M a few hours, L a session). Every row was checked against
the running app on this head (`serve.sh 8850`), not against the docs: four of
the five tails the brief named were already built.

## Named in the brief, checked first

| Item | State on this head | Measured by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WHITEBOARD_PLAN decision 7's other half (one highlighter table, two renderers) | built 2026-09-20 | `sketchparity.js` 10/10 |
| The phone context bar comparison | decided and built (it pins) | `wbcontextphone.js` 6/6 at 390x844 |
| Sketch handles at zoom | built | `wbhandlezoom.js` 17/17 |
| The arrange panel items (INBOX 12) | built; the probe was stale | `wbinbox12.js` 4/6 to 6/6: it read the first of four `data-wb-ctx="arrange"` groups and reported the other ten missing |
| The mapux leftover list | bend-grip right-click built 2026-09-26, marquee Escape built 2026-09-23; the connect-drag cue built here (row 5) | `maptwokinds.js`, `wbmarqueeescape.js`, `maplinkcue.js` |
