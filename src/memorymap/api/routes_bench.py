"""`/models/bench`: run the model bench and read its report (I8, H3).

The bench itself is `ai/bench.py`. This is the door: one run at a time, on a
thread of its own (a forty-note run over two models is minutes, not a
request), stoppable, and its last report kept in the data folder so the
table is still there after a restart. "Use this one" is not a route of its
own: it is `POST /models/chat-model`, the same switch the model picker uses,
so the bench cannot apply a model differently from the way a person would.
