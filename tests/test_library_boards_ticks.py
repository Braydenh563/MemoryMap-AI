"""The Library's Boards & maps ticks line up with the cards drawn.

`syncLibraryBoardsTicks` (library.js) grafts a selection tick onto each card
whiteboard.js drew. It used to fetch the board list again and match it to the
cards by position, bailing when the lengths differed: it narrowed by the
search box and the sort but not by the Maps / Boards / All chip, so with a chip
on no card got a tick ("Select all" and the bulk Delete were dead under the
filters people use to find a map).

INBOX 496 ("it takes a while to load the boards and maps library subtab") took
the second fetch away: every visit asked for the whole list twice. Each card
now carries the board it was drawn from (`card.wbBoard`), so the tick is that
board whatever the filter, and the gallery and the tick cannot drift because
there is one list. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/boardticks.js` drives it in Chromium.
