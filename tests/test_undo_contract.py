"""Rule 1.8, one undo contract (WORLD_CLASS 1.8, decision 53, Brief 51 step 5).

A destructive act that reaches the server shows the undo bar through
`pushUndo` (status.js), with the toast's Undo being the same entry
(`offerUndo`); Ctrl+Z inside an editor or a board is that surface's own
history. Nothing else invents an undo. This fails on a function whose name
says undo, outside status.js, the stack's store, the editors' histories and
the board history module, unless it goes through the contract. `UNFOLDED` is
the ratchet: it may only shrink.
