"""Two connected notes with the same title can be told apart.

Found measuring the Notes connections rail (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D2): a note
linked to two notes both titled "rotate group note" drew two identical rows,
in the rail and in the Connections sheet, with nothing to choose between them
but a guess. The rows now carry a second, quiet cue only when their titles
collide: the category when the two differ, the date written when they do not
(and both when even the date matches, which is rare and still better than
nothing). A row whose title is its own carries no cue, so the column stays as
short as it was.

Two halves: the route says what the cue is made of (a note row's category and
when it was written; a private note's category stays back with its text), and
`connectionRowCues`, the pure function `buildConnectionGroups` draws with, is
run in node against the cases.
