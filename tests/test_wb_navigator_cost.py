"""The board overview costs little per pan frame (INBOX 431).

The owner, 2026-09-28: "the fit drag mini fit map on the whiteboard and
mindmap is reallllly glitchy and laggy." The overview (`#wb-navigator`) is one
widget on both surfaces. Measured before the fix on a 150-card board at a 4x
CPU throttle (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/minimapdrag.js`): a one-second drag of
its viewport rectangle took 9.7 seconds to deliver, with 9,222 forced layouts
and a p95 frame of 183ms. The drawing half of that, pinned here:

* `wbRenderNavigator` read every card's size (`offsetWidth`) between appends
  to the overview's SVG, so every item forced a fresh layout of the page: 151
  layouts per redraw of 150 items. It reads everything first now and writes
  once.
* That full redraw ran on every pan and zoom frame. A pan frame now moves the
  viewport rectangle (and, when the map rescales, sets one transform on the
  items group); the items are redrawn after a board render.

Static checks, because the suite cannot drive a pointer; the sweep is the
measurement.
