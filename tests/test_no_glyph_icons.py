"""An icon is an icon, not a character someone typed.

This app ships Phosphor and draws every icon with it: `setLabel(el, "ph:x")`
builds an `<i class="ph ph-x">`. A control whose whole content is the
character U+2715 looks like one of those from across the room and is nothing
of the kind up close. Measured on a button built through the app's own
`smallButton` helper, the two ways side by side:

    "✕"    system-ui  13.6px  weight 500
    "ph:x"      Phosphor   15.6px  weight 400

Two faces, two sizes, two weights, for the same control in the same row. That
is what the owner meant by "I want to strip all signs of being vibecoded by an
ai from the ui" (INBOX 263): not a taste in icons, a UI assembled from
whatever was to hand instead of from the set the app already has.

Seven download buttons said "⬇ Download" while the rest of the app said
`ph:download-simple Download`, and ten close buttons were a typed cross. This
fails the build if either comes back.

**What is not banned, and why the list is short.** An arrow in a sentence
("Settings → Models") is a breadcrumb, which is typography; an arrow key in
a shortcut list is the key's own name. Both stay. What is banned is a glyph
that stands where an icon belongs, so the test looks only at strings that are
*labels*: a string that is nothing but glyphs and spaces, or one whose first
or last non-space character is a banned glyph, which is where an icon goes.
