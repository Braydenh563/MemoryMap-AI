"""A save re-reads the notes it touched, not the notebook (audit 2026-10-05,
FE-05).

`loadEntries()` pages through every note: at 5,010 notes that was 27
requests and 5.3 MB per save, from 132 call sites. `refreshEntries(ids)`
(notes-list.js) asks `GET /entries?ids=` for the touched notes and patches
them into `allEntries`, falling back to the full read whenever it cannot
patch (tests/test_entries_by_ids.py holds the server half). The browser half
is `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/fe1005-save.js`: requests per save at 5,000 notes.

These hold the shape: the paths the audit named go through the patch, and the
count of full re-reads can only go down.
