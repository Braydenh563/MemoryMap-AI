"""A resent note is saved once, across restarts and races (audit 2026-10-05,
ARCH-23; INBOX 434 for restarts).

The offline queue resends a save whose answer was lost, with the same
`client_key`. The guard was an in-memory dict, checked, then created, then
remembered: two concurrent resends both created, and a resend after a
restart was a second note. The key is now a column with a unique index.
