// note-cards.js: map chips and previews, the board index, entryItem (the note
// card). Moved out of app.js on 2026-09-26 as one contiguous range (INBOX 426
// cc, docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/appjs-split.md). A classic script sharing
// app.js's globals, loaded in app.js's old order; nothing in an earlier file
// calls into it while the page loads (scratchpad/appjs-map.js --check).

// --- one map chip and one map preview, used everywhere ----------------------
//
//: MINDMAP_PLAN.md §5 item 12, and the sentence in it that is the whole
//: reason this exists: *"One `mapChip()` and one `mapPreview()`, used by all
//: of them: the app's recurring failure is the same object drawn five
//: ways."*
//:
//: It had already happened twice before this was written. The Library's board
//: card (`renderLibraryBoardsGallery`, whiteboard.js) drew the minimap with
//: edges, labels, a sketch squiggle and an edge-aware label side; the
//: dashboard's boards widget (`dashBoardThumb`, dashboard.js) drew the *same*
//: `preview_items` at a different scale with **no edges at all**, so the one
//: fact that distinguishes a map from a board was missing from one of the two
//: places a map appears. Neither was wrong on its own; they were two opinions
//: of one picture.
//:
//: Lives in app.js because five files draw these, whiteboard.js, dashboard.js,
//: the timeline and the note renderer here, and the chat transcript, and
//: app.js is the one loaded before all of them (see index.html's script
//: order).

//: The sizes a preview is ever drawn at. A named size rather than a pair of
//: numbers per call site: "the Library card's minimap" and "the dashboard
//: row's thumbnail" are the two real cases, and letting each caller pass its
//: own geometry is how the two drifted apart in the first place.
//:
//: `labels` is off at row size deliberately. Sixteen characters beside a 9×6
//: block is a legible texture in a 100×56 card; the same text in a 40×40
//: thumbnail is a smear.
//:
//: `w`/`h` are the *box the picture is letterboxed into*, not the viewBox:
//: since the drawing is now made at the board's own ratio, the two are the
//: same only for a board that happens to be shaped like the card. Everything
//: else here (`pad`, `blockW`, `blockH`, `font`) is a size in that box, and
//: `mapPreview` divides each of them by the scale the browser is about to
//: apply, so a node in a tall map is drawn the same number of pixels across
//: as a node in a wide one. Without that division the block sizes are in
//: viewBox units and a square board's nodes come out 44% smaller than a wide
//: board's, for no reason a reader could see.
const MAP_PREVIEW_SIZES = {
  card: { w: 100, h: 56, pad: 3, blockW: 9, blockH: 6, labels: true, font: 4.2 },
  row: { w: 40, h: 40, pad: 3, blockW: 4, blockH: 3, labels: false, font: 0 },
};

//: The long side of the board's own box, in viewBox units. Arbitrary: only
//: the *ratio* of the viewBox is meaningful, since `preserveAspectRatio`
//: scales it into the card either way. 100 keeps the numbers in the DOM
//: readable when someone inspects a thumbnail.
const MAP_PREVIEW_BASE = 100;

//: How round a node is, as a fraction of its short side. A node on the canvas
//: is a rounded card, not a dot and not a pill, and the miniature says the
//: same thing at a twentieth of the size.
//:
//: **Was 0.35, and 0.35 is a blob** (INBOX 164: "board previews need upgrading
//: and fixing", with a screenshot of a wash of rounded blobs). Measured on a
//: seeded board at 1440 (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/boardpreview.js`): every block
//: came out 52.9x24.7 with a rendered corner radius of 8.66px, which is 35% of
//: its own short side. A rectangle whose corners eat a third of its height is
//: not a rounded rectangle, and nothing on the canvas looks like that: a note
//: card is `--radius`, 10px on a 150px side, which is 7%.
const MAP_PREVIEW_NODE_ROUNDING = 0.22;

//: And the ceiling that does the real work, in the nominal units
//: `MAP_PREVIEW_SIZES` is written in. A fraction of the short side alone cannot
//: be right at both sizes this preview draws at: the same 22% is a gentle
//: corner on a 25px-tall block in a Library card and a pill on a 4px one in a
//: dashboard row. It is divided back out by the box's own scale below, so the
//: corner is the same size whatever shape the board is, and the fraction is
//: left as the floor for a block too small to carry it.
//:
//: The nominal box is not pixels: a `card` is 100x56 here and measured 293.5px
//: wide in the Library, so one unit is about 2.9 rendered pixels, and 0.8 of one
//: is the 2px corner a note card has on the canvas.
const MAP_PREVIEW_CORNER_UNITS = 0.8;

//: The floor on a block's drawn size, as a multiple of the size every block
//: used to be. A small object on a large board is a fraction of a viewBox
//: unit once it is drawn to scale, and a preview whose smallest things are
//: invisible is a preview of the big ones only.
const MAP_PREVIEW_MIN_BLOCK = 0.5;

//: A character's width as a fraction of the type size. Still here as the

//:
//: **It is no longer what decides whether a label fits**, and the reason is a
//: measurement. An estimate that is 0.55 when the font draws wider puts the
//: text past the room it was budgeted, and the budget is what every later
//: decision is made from: measured on a seeded board, "body text" was
//: budgeted into a margin and painted 20.0 units wide starting at x=100.1 in

//: from a hidden SVG carrying `.board-minimap`, so the drawn family and weight
//: apply: measuring in another font is wrong with confidence. It used to be
//: `getComputedTextLength` on that SVG, and `mapPreviewFitText` asks for every
