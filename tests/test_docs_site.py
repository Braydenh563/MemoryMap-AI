"""The GitHub Pages landing site is static, self-contained and cannot go stale.

History. The site used to fetch the repository's Markdown documents at run
time and render them in tabs. That failed in several shapes over its life
(no `.nojekyll`, so Pages converted the `.md` sources rather than publishing
them; cross-origin hosts that adblockers and rate limits refused), and the
owner's verdict was INBOX 645: "it for some reason struggles to load the
documents from the repo so I think we should remove them and just have a
solid landing site which doesn't really have a problem with having to be kept
up to date". So `docs/index.html` is now one static page: no fetch of any
kind, nothing loaded from another host, screenshots by relative path only,
and every document reached by an absolute GitHub link, which always shows the
current text. These tests hold each of those rules, plus the one that keeps
it from going stale: the copy names no version, no date and no count.
