"""The parity scorecard's engine columns (CHAT_PLAN decision 58), the ones
measurable with no model: variety (decision 51's floor), structure (the
maxims lint, decision 52), grounding (every eval clause traced) and acts
(each with an inverse, decision 53). Brief 68 prints decision 58's six
columns (understanding, grounding, structure, variety, follow-up, repair),
the engine's number beside a model's: the model column reads "not run" when
no `MEMORYMAP_EVALS_URL` model is set (CLAUDE.md section 4).
