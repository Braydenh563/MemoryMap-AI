"""Three notes a day that are slipping out of reach (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I4).

A notebook that only ever shows you what you just wrote is a diary. The thing
a notebook can do that a pile of files cannot is bring back the note you would
never have thought to look for: written months ago, linked to nothing, never
opened since. That is what "faded" means here, and it is deliberately made of
three facts a person can check rather than a model's opinion:

- **age**, because a note you wrote this morning is not lost,
- **links**, because a note joined to others is reachable through them,
- **reads**, because a note you keep opening is not forgotten.

The score is computed nightly into `note_scores` (`compute_scores`), and the
request-time step is a sort plus, when there is something to compare against,
a cosine to what the person is looking at now (`for_context`). That split is
the whole performance story: the scan is the expensive half and it does not
need to be fresh, the cosine is the cheap half and does.

**Three rules that keep it from becoming noise**, each one a failure this
feature has in other tools:

1. A small notebook gets nothing. Three cards a day out of five notes is the
   same three notes for ever, which teaches people to ignore the panel.
2. The day's three are stable within the day and different the next. A panel
   that reshuffles on every page load is a slot machine, and one that never
   reshuffles is wallpaper.
3. "Never again" is honoured for good, through the corrections loop
   (`ai/learning.py`), so dismissing a card is a decision rather than a
   thirty-second reprieve.
