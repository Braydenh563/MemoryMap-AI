// MemoryMap AI: the graph's force simulation, off the main thread.
//
// GRAPH_PLAN.md §4 ("Simulation off the main thread") and §5 Phase 1. The SVG
// renderer this replaces ran `d3.forceSimulation` on the main thread and wrote
// thousands of DOM attributes per tick, so the simulation and the pointer
// fought for the same thread and a drag stuttered. Here the simulation owns a
// worker, and the main thread only ever paints what this posts.
//
// **d3 is vendored, and `importScripts` is what a classic worker has.** The
// app ships `/vendor/d3.v7.min.js` (no CDN: the offline rule), it is a UMD
// bundle, so `importScripts` puts `d3` on this worker's own global. The CSP
// already allows it: `worker-src 'self'` is set in
// `src/memorymap/core/security.py` (checked before writing this, not assumed, 
// a directive missing there fails silently, which is the "policy silently
// refusing the work" shape CLAUDE.md names).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The protocol, in both directions. Kept small on purpose: every message is
// structured-cloned, so anything that travels per frame has to be a buffer.
//
// In:
//   {type:"init", nodes:[{id,x,y,fx,fy,r}], edges:[{source,target,kind,score}],
//    params:{gravity,spread,lengthByScore}, world:{left,top,right,bottom}, alpha, epoch}
//       Replace the whole simulation. `id` is only used to map the drag/pin
//       messages below onto array indices; positions travel by index alone.
//       `epoch` is echoed on every message this run produces: see "Out".
//   {type:"params", params:{gravity,spread}}      re-tune without a rebuild
//   {type:"drag", phase:"start"|"move"|"end", id, x, y, keep}
//       start -> alphaTarget(0.3) and pin; move -> move the pin; end ->
//       alphaTarget(0) and, unless `keep`, release the pin.
//   {type:"freeze", ids:[...]} / {type:"thaw"}
//       Hold everything else still for the length of a drag, the same
//       "aiming at a moving target is not a gesture" fix the SVG renderer
//       carried, kept because drag-to-link still depends on it.
//   {type:"pin", id, x, y} / {type:"unpin", id}   double-click hold / release
//   {type:"reheat", alpha}                        nudge a settled layout
//   {type:"reshuffle", seed, animate}             a new arrangement: see below
//   {type:"stop"}                                 leave the tab
//   {type:"recycle", buffer}                      hand a position buffer back
//
// Out:
//   {type:"tick", positions:Float32Array (transferred), alpha, running, epoch}
//       x,y interleaved, one pair per node, in the order `init` supplied.
//   {type:"end", alpha, epoch}
//                         the layout has settled; no further ticks are coming
//                         until something reheats it.
//
// **Why every message out carries the `epoch` its `init` came with.** Both
// directions of `postMessage` are asynchronous, so `{type:"stop"}` cannot
// unsend a tick that has already been posted: it clears the timer here and
// the tick sitting in the main thread's queue is still delivered afterwards.
// The main thread applies positions *by index*, so a tick from the previous
// simulation landing after the node array has been replaced writes the old
// solution over the new one. That is what a tree drawn as a scatter is, and
// it is why it happened only when the layout was switched while the force
// simulation was still warm. The epoch lets the reader of a message decide
// whether it is still about the graph on screen.
