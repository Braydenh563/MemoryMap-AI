"""Making the mind map's node fill and canvas background colours findable
(coordinator ask): the owner asked for these without knowing they already
exist (`#wb-map-strip-color`, `#wb-bg-color-picker`, both wired and both
already used by PNG/SVG export, `tests/test_export_paint.py`). Nothing that
opens by right-click ever named the colour well, so this adds the one thing
that was actually missing: a words door to it, plus a mention of both wells
in the map's own "Where the map's controls live" help.

No new colour control: both changes point at the picker that was already
there.
