"""The bounded background pool (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN A3, section 4 B2).

The bug these tests pin: every upload used to spawn up to three
`threading.Thread`s of its own, so a folder of 200 pictures was 600 threads
hitting one Ollama and one Tesseract at once. Three properties make that
impossible, and each is measured rather than read off the code:

1. a lane never runs more than its width at once, under load (50 jobs),
2. shutdown returns inside its deadline even with work still queued,
3. a single-width lane runs its jobs in the order they were enqueued.
