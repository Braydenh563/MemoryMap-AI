"""Every catalogue row lands on the thing it names.

Reported (the owner, 2026-09-24): "make sure that the tools and features panel
options, as well as the command palatte and find anything search actually show
what they are. like I clicked on the "suggested links" option in the tools and
features panel and all it did was take me to the graph page, it didnt actually
open the menu option for suggested links in the graph like it should have."

Measured before the fix (a read of every closure): of the 110 written rows in
"Tools and features", 50 did no more than switch tab (or open a parent view)
while naming one control on it, 11 more opened a Settings pane at its top while
naming one setting in it, every one of the AI tool rows built from
`/chat/tools` opened that pane at its top too, and the palette's two board rows
did nothing at all unless a board was already open. The cause was the shape of the rows: each was a hand-written closure, and
`switchTab("graph")` is the shortest closure that looks like it works.

So a row no longer carries a closure. It *declares* where it goes, one of:

* `tab: "graph"`: the row names a tab and the tab is the whole answer
  ("Graph view", "Go to Notes").
* `reveal: "graph-suggest"`: the row names something on a tab, in a menu or
  behind a dialog; `revealFeature` (app.js) switches tab, waits for the lazy
  bundle, opens the menu, panel or dialog, and rings the control with the
  app's own jump-to highlight. The targets live in one table,
  `REVEAL_TARGETS`, and `settings:<section>` names a Settings pane.
* `act: fn`: the row is a command that changes something where you already
  are (zoom, the theme, lock, a download). It has no place to land, and an
  act may not switch tab: a row that goes somewhere is a reveal.

What this file checks, statically: every row declares exactly one of the
three; every tab exists; every reveal key exists; every target names an
element that is in index.html, or a selector plus the named function that
builds it at runtime. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/deeplinks.js` is the other half:
it runs every row in a browser and checks the named control is on screen.
