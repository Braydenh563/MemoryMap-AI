"""The width breakpoints are a design, stated once (audit 2026-10-05, FE-11).

UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN Phase 9 named four layouts (under 600, 600 to 820, 820
to 1100, 1100 and over), written `max-width: 599.98px` / `min-width: 600px`
and so on, so a window exactly 600 wide is on one side. The audit counted 58
distinct width queries, and two conventions colliding: `max-width: 600px`
(24 rules) with `min-width: 600px` (15), and `max-width: 720px` with
`min-width: 720px`, both sides matching at exactly that width.

Two rules, read from every stylesheet:

- **No width is on both sides.** A `max-width: W` and a `min-width: W`
  (rem and em at 16px) both match a window W wide.
- **The set only shrinks.** A width outside Phase 9's is either a named
  component's own (listed below, with how many rules use it) or it fails;
  the counts may only go down. The 720, 640 and 900 groups were moved onto
  the Phase 9 set on 2026-10-05 with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/bands.js` (a
  before and after at 390 to 1440); the rules left in them are listed.
  The 900 group's header rules moved first, with
  `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/perf2-1005-bp900.js`.
