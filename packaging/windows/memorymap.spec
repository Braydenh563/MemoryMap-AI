# PyInstaller spec for the Windows desktop build.
#
# Built on windows-latest in CI (.github/workflows/release.yml), never on
# this developer's own machine — PyInstaller bundles for the OS it runs on,
# it does not cross-compile, so a spec written and reasoned about here is
# unverified until that workflow actually runs it. Read this file's own
# comments as "why", not "confirmed working."
#
# Usage (from the repo root, on Windows):
#   pip install -e ".[desktop]" pyinstaller
#   pyinstaller packaging/windows/memorymap.spec --distpath dist --workpath build
#
# Produces dist/MemoryMap AI/MemoryMap AI.exe (onedir, not onefile — see
# below for why) plus everything it needs beside it. installer.iss in this
# same folder packages that whole folder into the actual installer.

# **The IANA time zone database, which Windows does not have.** zoneinfo
# reads the system's zone files on Linux and macOS and the `tzdata` package
# on Windows, and nothing in the build installed that package: the packaged
# app refused the timezone the window reports on every start (the
# `/preferences` validator raised ZoneInfoNotFoundError for every zone name,
# "Europe/London" included) and read "today" and "in ten minutes" on the
# machine's zone instead of the person's. Imported here, not just listed,
# so a build environment without it fails at this line rather than shipping
# a build that quietly lacks it; PyInstaller's own zoneinfo hook then bundles
# the data on Windows.

# **Every module of the app, by file, not by whatever the analysis can see.**
# PyInstaller follows `import x` statements; it does not follow
# `importlib.import_module("x")`, and this app reaches several of its own
# modules only that way (to keep `core/` free of import cycles, ARCH-10).
# Measured on a build of this spec: 198 of 200 modules bundled, and one of the
# two missing was `memorymap.ai.needle_provider`, which `ai/tool_fallback.py`
# imports by name, so the needle extra (tool calling without Ollama) raised
# ModuleNotFoundError on every packaged install. The searxng facades below
# were the same bug found earlier by a support bundle. Listing the package's
# files makes the next such module impossible to miss;
# tests/test_frozen_packaging.py checks the list against what is imported by
# name. `memorymap.__main__` is left out on purpose: it is the entry script,
# and a second copy under its package name is what `routes_settings.
# _desktop_entry` takes care never to import.

# **The whole standard library, for the optional packages.** A packaged build
# carries only the standard-library modules the app itself imports, and the
# extras (Settings > Packages, the installer's optional page) are installed
# later, into the data folder, and run on the bundle's own interpreter. Any
# standard module they import that the app never did is simply not there.
# Measured on a build of this spec against what the extras import:
# `transformers` imports `filecmp` at the top of a module its auto classes
# load, so search by meaning (the recommended, ticked-by-default extra) could
# not import; `pypdfium2` and `scipy` need `ctypes.util`, `lxml` and `numpy`
# `optparse`, `huggingface_hub` `venv`. A list of those five would be the next
# missing one waiting to happen, so every module of the standard library is
# named, apart from the GUI toolkit, the test suite, the bundled pip wheels
# and the IDE, which no extra uses and which would add megabytes (Tk alone
# brings its own DLLs). Measured cost: 3 MB (183.3 to 186.2 MB, Linux build).
