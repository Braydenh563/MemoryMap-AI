"""Give the seeded uploads the readings INBOX 279's screenshots show.

`seed-libtext.js` uploads the files; this writes what a vision model would
have written, because there is none in the sandbox and the shape under test is
the rendered card, not the inference. Two things go in:

* the images get a caption, a caption model, a vision reading and its model,
  which is every rank the image card's foot can carry;
* the PDFs get fourteen `page_reads` rows each, so `pages_read` is 14 and the
  joined reading is long enough for the Files block's word count to be a real
  number rather than a handful.
