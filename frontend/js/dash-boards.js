// dash-boards.js: the dashboard's Boards & maps widget. Moved out of
// dashboard.js on 2026-10-05 (the boot-script gzip budget, 86 bytes from its
// cap) when the widget gained its large map (INBOX 553(d)); loaded on the
// widget's first draw (`ensureModule("dashBoards")`, app.js), and calls only
// into files that are always there (note-cards.js, dashboard.js).

//: **The busiest map, drawn large, at its own shape** (INBOX 553(d), the
//: owner's decision: the widget is "dynamic depending on map size and
//: scale"). The rows' 40px thumbnails letterbox every board into the same
//: square, so a map was a smudge. The first board gets the widget's width and
//: a height that follows it: its natural height at that width (the width over
//: the map's own aspect), at least `min` so a long thin map is still a
//: picture, at most `small` when the map has only a few topics (so three
//: boxes are drawn at a readable size, not blown up to fill a card), and at
//: most `max` otherwise, past which the whole map is fitted inside (the
//: preview's `meet`), so a tall map gets a taller card up to a limit and is
//: then shown whole.
