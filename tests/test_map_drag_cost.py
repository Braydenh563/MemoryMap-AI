"""Picking a map topic up costs its branch, not the board (MINDMAP_PLAN 13a).

`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/mapperf.js` is the real gate here: it drives a pointer
across a 500-topic map in a real Chromium and reports the worst frame of the
gesture. This file cannot do that, and nothing in it should be mistaken for
the measurement. What it can do is hold the *shape* the measurement came from,
because every one of the costs below reads as ordinary code and only shows up
as a number under a profiler:

    worst drag frame, mapperf.js        50        200        500
    before                           83.3ms    416.6ms   1650.0ms
    after                            16.8ms     33.3ms     66.7ms

Each rule here is one of those costs. They are written against the source
because the suite cannot open a board; if one fails, the question to ask is
"what does this do per frame now", not "how do I word the rule differently".
