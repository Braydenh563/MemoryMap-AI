"""INBOX 608: a marquee or an item dragged to the board's edge pans it.

The owner: "when I drag select off the screen on the whiteboard and mind map
... it doesnt scroll down or up or the way I am dragging". The browser
measurement is scratchpad/ui-sweeps/bm1005-edgepan.js (a held marquee and a
held item each pan hundreds of pixels a second; the item stays under the
pointer). These pin the wiring that measurement depends on.
