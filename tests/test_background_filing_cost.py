"""What one background filing costs, counted rather than timed (INBOX 434).

The wall-clock figures (1.2 to 4 s for "filed") came from one encode on
torch's default thread pool (`tests/test_embedding_threads.py`); what is left
is structure, and structure can be counted: how many times the model is
asked, and how many statements the job issues however big the notebook is.
Neither depends on the machine, so a regression shows up as a failed
assertion rather than as a slow afternoon.
