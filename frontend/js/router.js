// router.js: every view has an address (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 22.1 item 1).
//
// Each view gets a hash (`#/notes/12`, `#/chat/45`, `#/docs/7`,
// `#/library/images`, `#/settings/appearance`), and this file keeps three
// things in step: navigation.js's back stack (the source of truth for what a
// step is and how to go back to one, `openHistoryEntry`), the address bar (a
// new view is pushed, a refinement replaces) and the window title.
//
// `popstate` drives navigation: the in-app Back and Forward call `history.go`
// and the browser's answer opens the entry its state names. A hash with no
// entry behind it (a pasted link, a bookmark) opens as a fresh visit; one that
// is not a route (a heading anchor, `#intro`) is left alone. Nothing runs at
// load but the listener and the address the page was opened with, which the
// boot opens after the unlock (`routerRestore`, app.js).
