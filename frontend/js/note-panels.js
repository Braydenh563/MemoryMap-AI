// note-panels.js: the rows a note card's menu opens under it, "Similar notes",
// "Referenced by", "Forgotten notes like this", and the reminders chip's list.
// Moved out of notes-list.js on 2026-10-05 (the boot-script gzip budget,
// ratchet in tests/test_static_compression.py): each opens only from a menu
// item or a chip a person presses, so none of it is needed to draw the list.
// Loaded on first use by `LAZY_MODULES.notePanels` (app.js), whose stand-ins
// for `toggleRelated`, `toggleReferences`, `toggleFaded` and
// `toggleNoteReminders` fetch this file and then call the real one; all four
// are `async` and nobody reads what they return.
//
// `similarNoteRow` is here too, at the bottom: its only callers are
// `toggleRelated` and the edit form's own "Similar" panel
// (note-edit-panels.js), and it returns an element, which a stand-in could not
// give a caller at boot. The two files load together as one bundle
// (`LAZY_MODULES.notePanels`) so neither can run without it.
// `renderEntries` never reads `notePanel`, so the open-panel state living here
// costs the list nothing while this file is absent.

//: **One open panel, named by which one it is.** Three menu items open a row
//: under a note card: "Similar notes", "Referenced by" and "Forgotten notes
//: like this". Each kept its own open-id, and two of them said in their own
//: comments that there should only be one, which is what happens when a
//: third arrives: opening one left the others' ids set, so the next click on
//: a *different* panel toggled the stale id instead and did nothing visible.
//:
//: One id and one kind, because the panels genuinely are one thing: they draw
//: the same `.entry-links` row in the same place on the same card, and
//: `renderEntries` clears whichever is showing, so only one can ever be on
//: screen anyway. The variable now says that rather than three variables
//: agreeing by accident.
