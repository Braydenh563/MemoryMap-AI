"""No stylesheet makes a class change restyle a whole subtree.

**Why this exists (MINDMAP_PLAN.md 13a-view).** A browser keeps, for each
class name and attribute a selector mentions, the list of elements a change
to it can affect, so toggling `.is-open` on one element restyles only what
the rules about `.is-open` can reach. There is one shape it cannot narrow: an
attribute selector on `class` itself (`[class*="card"]`, `[class^="wb-"]`)
in an *ancestor* position. Any class change on any element might have just
made it match, so the browser has to restyle that element's whole subtree on
every class change, for every element in the app.

One rule of that shape was in Settings (`#settings-modal .settings-section
[class*="card"] *`). Measured on a 500-topic mind map, toggling one
unrelated class on the board's container restyled 13,662 elements in 218ms;
with the rule gone, 0.1ms. The id in front of it did not help: the browser
cannot know an element is outside `#settings-modal` until it has restyled it.

So the lint is exactly that shape: a `[class` attribute selector in a
compound that is followed by a descendant or child combinator. The same
selector as the *last* compound (the element itself) is fine, and so is one
followed by a sibling combinator, which reaches one sibling rather than a
subtree.
