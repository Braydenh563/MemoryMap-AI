"""The motion pass stays a recipe, and stays cheap (INBOX 459 (2)).

The owner asked for "cheap css animations to things like the horizontal pill
selectors and sidebars ... but dont over do it in a vibecoded way". DESIGN.md's
recipe index has one "Motion" row for what came of it; this holds the row:

- **One indicator.** A selection that moves between options (a `.seg`, the top
  bar's tabs, the sub-tab strips, the Settings sections and a pane's groups)
  is drawn by one shared recipe: the strip's `::before`, placed on the chosen
  option by `glideStrip` (shell-reminders.js) through `--glide-x/y/w/h`, and
  moved from where it was drawn by a `transform` animation on that
  pseudo-element (the owner, 2026-10-05: "Also like the smooth slide across
  tabs"). A second indicator, per control, is how ten strips end up moving
  ten ways. It replaced a CSS-anchored `::before` whose four insets were the
  one layout property in motion in the app, so no inset moves anywhere now.
- **Only the compositor's properties move.** Every rule in a section headed
  `/* --- motion:` transitions or starts from `opacity`, `transform`,
  `translate`, `scale` or a colour, and nothing else.

Reduced motion is not a rule here: the polish follows Interface animations
(`data-ui-motion`, the `--ui-*` tokens; `tests/test_motion_tokens.py`), and
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/motion1005.js` measures the indicator gliding with the
switch on under reduced motion and landing at once with it off. Like the other frontend lints this cannot see the
DOM; the sweep is what runs against a browser.
