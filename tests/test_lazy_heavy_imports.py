"""The AI/search modules must not drag numpy in just by being imported.

The owner measured the idle backend at ~776 MB resident and asked for one
specific fix: lazy-load the heavy imports, not idle suspension (the runtime
side of that, when the embedding model itself actually loads, is already
handled well by `ai/embeddings.start_warmup`'s delay/idle-wait/empty-notebook
skip). What was still missing is that `import numpy as np` sat at the *top*
of `ai/embeddings.py`, `ai/janitor.py`, `search/engine.py` and
`search/search_manager.py`, so merely importing one of those modules, which
`api/app.py` and half its routers do unconditionally at process start to wire
up routes and the `EmbeddingService` singleton, cost numpy's own import
(measured: ~16 MB / ~60-100 ms in this sandbox) whether or not the notebook
had anything worth embedding yet.

Each of those four files now imports numpy inside the specific functions and
methods that call `np.*`, the same shape `_load_st_model` in
`ai/embeddings.py` already used for `sentence_transformers` (a heavy,
optional import deferred to the one place that needs it) and `__main__.py`
uses for `uvicorn`/`create_app`. `from __future__ import annotations` is
already present in all four files, so every remaining module-level `np.`
reference is a type annotation, stored as a string and never evaluated,
never a real import.

This is a subprocess check, not a plain `assert "numpy" not in sys.modules`
in-process: numpy, once imported by an earlier test in the same pytest
run, stays in `sys.modules` for the rest of that process, which would make
this pass regardless of whether the module under test still imports it
itself. A fresh interpreter is the only way to see the real, first-import
cost.
