"""What "yesterday" meant, on the day it was written (roadmap §10A).

Notes are full of relative time, "tomorrow", "last week", "in three days" , 
and every one of those phrases is correct when it is typed and misleading
forever afterwards. Nothing recorded what they resolved to, so a note saying
"the deadline is next Friday" is unanswerable a month later, and the AI
answering questions about it can only guess.

This resolves them at capture and stores the answer alongside the note.

**Deliberately deterministic.** `ai/reminder_parser.py` asks the model to do
the same job for a reminder, and that is the right trade there: one reminder,
typed on purpose, worth a model call. This runs on *every* note that is saved,
including when Ollama is off, the app's second design principle, so it is
regular expressions and arithmetic, and nothing here can make a save fail or
slow.

The reference clock is the user's, not the server's. "Tonight" resolved
against UTC on a machine in Brisbane is the wrong night, which is exactly the
bug the reminder columns were fixed for.
