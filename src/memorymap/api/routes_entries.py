    `core/ocr.py`'s `extract_in_background` uses and for the same reason:
    the request this belongs to is finished, and the user is already typing
    the next note.

    Two things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

    **The workspace has to be re-established by hand.** A fresh session from
    `deps.get_db()` carries no `workspace_id` in `session.info`, so the
    scoping hooks in `core/database.py` sit out entirely: which means the
    janitor would otherwise weigh *every space's* categories when deciding
    where a note from one space belongs, and could file it into a category
    that space cannot even see. `impersonate_workspace` puts the session
    back in the note's own space for the duration.

    **The note is never left saying "pending" forever.** Every exit path, 
    success, a janitor that raised, an entry deleted while the thread was
    still running: settles `filing_state`, because the composer's status
    chip and the poller in `app.js` both read it as "still working" and a
    stuck value would show a note filing itself for eternity.

    **Filing is not the only slow thing in a save**, and deferring it alone
    left the request at ~1s measured locally with no model running at all.
    Embedding the note and the near-duplicate search (itself a full semantic
    search, run only to *maybe* show an advisory toast) were the rest of it,
    and neither is anything the composer needs before the user can start
    typing again. They move here too. The duplicate warning comes back
    through `GET /entries/{id}/filing` instead of the create response, so a
    note that triggers one still gets its "you already wrote something like
    this", a moment later, in the same notification that says where it was

# --- D6: the journal's daily note (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 13, D6) ----------
#
# The convention came first and stays: a daily note is an ordinary note whose
# first line is `# <ISO date>` (`dailyNoteTitle` in app.js). Nothing about it
# is special, which is the point: it is searchable, it is in the graph, it
# exports, and a notebook opened in another editor still has it.
#
# **What was missing is the "or returns" half.** `startTodaysNote` posts a new
# note every time it is pressed, so opening today's journal twice in a day
# leaves two notes both headed with today's date and the writing split between
# them. D6's brief asks for `/entries/daily/{date}` "that creates or returns",
# and that is what makes the key safe to press from anywhere, which is the
# rest of D6 (Ctrl+D, the calendar strip, the streak) built on top.
#
# **The date is the caller's, never the server's.** "Today" is a fact about
# where the person is sitting, and this process may be in another timezone
# (`entry/timewords.py` makes the same argument at length). So the day is a
# path parameter and the server never guesses it.
#
# **The template body is not written here.** The four built-in templates'
# markdown only ever lived in the frontend (`BUILTIN_TEMPLATE_NAMES` in
# routes_settings.py records that, and why). The server writes the heading
# that makes the note findable; anything under it is the person's to type or
# the frontend's to prefill on the first open.

#: The day heading, and the only thing that makes a note a daily note.

    *"similar in meaning"*, which is what was reported: the button appeared to
