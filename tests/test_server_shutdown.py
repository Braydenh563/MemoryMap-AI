"""The server-mode process used to sit for 5 to 9 seconds after uvicorn had
already logged "Finished server process" (INBOX 423i).

**The thread.** Almost every route in this app is a plain `def`, not an
`async def`, so Starlette runs each one through `anyio.to_thread.run_sync`,
which is backed by a small pool of "AnyIO worker thread" objects. Each one is
supposed to stop itself once the server's own root asyncio task finishes, but
that stop is scheduled as a callback for the event loop's *next* iteration,
and `uvicorn.run()` can tear the loop down before that iteration happens. A
worker left over that way is not a daemon thread, so Python's own interpreter
shutdown, which joins every non-daemon thread with no timeout before the
process can exit, sits waiting on it.

Measured directly (`scratchpad/` is not the place for a one-off repro, so the
numbers are recorded here instead): a real `uvicorn.Server` handling one sync
request and then shutting down consistently leaves an "AnyIO worker thread"
alive and `daemon=False` at the moment `Server.run()` returns, and Python's
own process took an extra 1.8 to 4.6 seconds to actually disappear because of
it, on top of whatever else interpreter teardown costs on this machine. The
worst case is unbounded: nothing tells that thread to stop, so how long it
survives is a race with anyio's own `MAX_IDLE_TIME` (10 seconds), not a
guarantee.

`_stop_lingering_worker_threads` (`__main__.py`, called right after
`uvicorn.run()` returns in `_run_server`) asks any thread of exactly that
class to stop, the same way anyio's own done-callback would have, and bounds
the wait rather than trusting it to be instant. This test reproduces the
leftover thread with a real `uvicorn.Server` running this app's own
`create_app()` and checks the fix actually clears it inside the 1 second
budget. A bare FastAPI app with one throwaway route did not reproduce this
reliably: the leftover thread comes from a race (anyio's done-callback for
the *next* event loop iteration against `uvicorn.run()` tearing the loop
down), and it is this app's own startup work, the embeddings warmup thread,
the autonomous scheduler, that is enough concurrent activity to make that
race land the same way it does for a real launch.
