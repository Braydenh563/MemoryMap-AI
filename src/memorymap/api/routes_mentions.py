"""A note's backlinks with their sentence, and its unlinked mentions turned
into links in one click (GRAPH_PLAN KG1, INBOX 528).

Documents had both since DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 4 (`routes_documents._backlinks`);
a note had only a "mentions it" row with no sentence and nothing to press.
The scanner is shared (`entry/mentions.py`), so "a mention" means one thing
for both kinds.

**Its own router** because the link action writes through both
`routes_entries.update_entry` and `routes_documents.update_document` (the
revision, the wiki sync, the vector refresh, the conflict guard all live
there), and `routes_documents` already reads `routes_entries`: a third module
that reads both closes no import cycle.

**The span is checked here, not in the browser.** The offsets were taken
when the list was drawn; a source edited since answers 409 and is not
touched, because a stale offset rewrites the wrong words of somebody's note.
