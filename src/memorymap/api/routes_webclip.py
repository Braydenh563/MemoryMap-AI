"""`POST /links/clip`: keep a web page as a note (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN D9).

The fetch, the address checks and the extraction are `core/webclip.py`; this
is the door, and the one rule that belongs at the door: **nothing goes online
unless the person has said the web may be used.** The clipper shares the web
reader's opt-in (`web_search_enabled`, Settings → Web search) rather than
having a switch of its own, because "may this app reach the web when I ask"
is one question, and two switches that answer it differently would be a
promise kept in one place and broken in the other.

The note goes through the same path as one typed into Capture
(`routes_entries.create_entry`), so it is filed, embedded and indexed like
any other, and a clipped page is found by search by its words.

# page being read and hands it that page: its address, its title, its HTML as
# the browser has it (pages behind a sign-in the person can see included),
# and any text they had selected. Nothing is fetched, so the web switch above
# does not apply: the page is already on this computer.

# The text is somebody else's. It is stored with its `source_url`, which is
