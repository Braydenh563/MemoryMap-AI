"""Ctrl+Z after an agent run takes back its last write (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM
"Deepened 2026-10-10" row 4, WORLD_CLASS decision 53): every write the agent
makes goes on the app-wide undo stack as its tool event arrives, in Chat and
in the agent panel, and the run's own Undo stays for the whole.

The browser half was driven with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/agentplan87.js`
against the scripted fake model; these hold the wiring and the server half.
