"""The `[[` picker offers the note you are naming before the notes that mention it.

`editorLinkMatches` (frontend/js/editor.js) kept every note whose text held the
typed words anywhere, in list order (newest first), and showed the first six.
Typing `[[Alpha` in a notebook where several newer notes link to "Alpha
project" listed those, with Enter taking the first, and the note called Alpha
project was sixth or missing altogether. Found by
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/deepflows.js`'s capture probe (Enter put `[[# Theta
fitness]]` in the text after `[[Alph`).

Notes whose opening line starts with the words come first, then those whose
opening line holds them, then the ones that only mention them in the body; the
list keeps its own order within each.
