"""`requests`, for the model backends, with redirects held to the address asked.

WORLD_CLASS_PLAN §12, S6. The model backend's address is one the person set,
and it is on this machine or this network by design (`local_only_ai`,
`security.check_backend_url`), so the address itself is not the risk. A
redirect is. `requests` follows one to anywhere unless told otherwise, so a
server at the configured address, or anything able to answer as it, could send
the app's next request on to another host: prompts carrying notes to a
different machine on the LAN, or a probe to the cloud metadata address the
backend check refuses when it is typed in directly.

So the two provider clients import this module in place of `requests`
(`from memorymap.ai import provider_http as requests`), and every call they
make carries one response hook: a redirect whose target is not the same
scheme, host and port as the response that sent it is refused with a reason,
before `requests` follows it. A redirect on the same address (a moved path, a
trailing slash) is still followed, because local servers do send those.

A module rather than a keyword at each of the fifteen call sites, for two
reasons. The call sites stay as they read. And the tests' fakes, which patch
`openai_client.requests.post` with fixed signatures, patch this module's
`post` exactly as they patched the real one, and see the same arguments.
