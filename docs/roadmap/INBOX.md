# Inbox: things the owner dropped in while work was in flight

**How this file is used (the interrupt rule).** Anything the owner sends
while a step is in progress (a bug, a screenshot, a request, an opinion,
a usage figure) is appended here verbatim with the time, and NOT acted on
until the step in hand has passed its gate and is committed. Then, at that
boundary only, the inbox is triaged in one pass:

1. A bug in something built this session goes next (it is cheaper now).
2. A bug elsewhere goes into the relevant `agent-remaining/*.md` or
   BACKLOG row with the owner's words, and is scheduled by impact.
3. A feature or design request becomes a brief row (SESSION_BRIEFS or the
   plan it belongs to); it is not built ad hoc.
4. An opinion or a decision is recorded in the plan it affects and
   followed from then on.
5. "X% usage" means commit and push now, then continue more tersely.

Each item is moved out of this file when it has a home, with one line in
the report saying where it went. The point: the owner's pile after a usage
reset is processed as a batch at a boundary, the step that was in flight is
finished to standard first, and the goals in HANDOVER's "Now" line are
never lost to the smaller stuff.

## Open items

INBOX is the intake tray, not a backlog (the owner, 2026-09-09: "it should
just be there to help you not miss anything"). A report lands here
verbatim, is triaged at the next step boundary, and leaves: fixed now (then
`scratchpad/inbox_resolve.py`), or placed as a row in the plan that owns it
("Placed from INBOX" sections). Under twenty items at any time, by lint.
What is here now is this PR's own bug list (Brief 18 section A, HANDOVER's
done-when item 4 and 5), in priority order.

77. **Half done, 2026-09-09: the badge is fixed.** It reads "1.2k / 20k"
    instead of "6% of window", is 20px tall at every width from 420 to 1440
    (it stretched to 44px below 820 before), and is centred against the chat
    subline. What is left is the second half below, the per-model context
    size, which the entry already assigns to the next session.
    **Token window badge: not centred, text wrong; the window itself
    should be manageable by the user and auto when set** (screenshots:
    "6% of window" pill off-centre in the chat header, and the header wraps
    at width). Owner: CHAT_PLAN header (Fable, now for the badge; the
    window setting next session): a `num_ctx` preference per model in
    Settings > Models with Auto (the model file's value) or a number, sent
    on every request; the badge shows "used / window".
