Split out of `searxng_manager.py` (see that module for the two backends and
why Docker is only the tidier one). Everything here is the docker-cli side of
it: is Docker there and its daemon up, create/start/stop the
`memorymap-searxng` container, and the loopback-only publishing rule (and the
guard that re-creates a container an earlier version published to every
interface, since publishing is fixed at container creation and `docker start`
can't change it).
