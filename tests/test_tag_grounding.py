"""The "Study" bug (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 23, decision 5): a tag is never proposed
on a note that contains none of its words.

The owner, 2026-10-10: "Study and university tags are suggested on the top
note if it has no tags no matter what the note is about". Two votes did it,
both reproduced here before the fix:

* **With no model**, `tagging.suggest` let the nearest notes vote
  for every tag they carry. In a notebook whose lecture notes all carry
  "study" and "university", a note sharing one ordinary word with them
  ("Friday", "books", "chapter") was offered both.
* **With a model**, `librarian.suggest_tags` lists the notebook's tags most
  used first and says "Prefer one of those"; a small model answers with the
  first two whatever the note says (`triage-1010.md`, line 23). That reply
  is faked here, since what a real model answers is not verified.

The fix is one rule on both paths, `tagging.grounds`: a tag is
kept only when the note says one of its words or a phrase of a topic the
tag names ("exam" backs #study, Education).
