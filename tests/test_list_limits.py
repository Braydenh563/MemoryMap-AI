"""Every list endpoint takes a limit, or says in writing why it does not.

WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 10, F2: "25 list endpoints, 3 accept `limit`. Every
list is O(notebook)." The count in that row was taken with `grep`, which
counts function definitions rather than routes and cannot tell a list of
chat modes (a fixed seven) from a list of every attachment in the notebook.
This walks the app the way `test_every_route_is_locked.py` does, so a route
added tomorrow is checked too, and it separates the two cases with an
allowlist that carries a reason per line rather than a count.

The rule is deliberately "takes a limit", not "paginates with a cursor". A
cursor is better for a list somebody scrolls and worse for a list somebody
counts, and half of these are read once into a dialog. What matters, and what
this asserts, is that no route's response size is decided by how long the
person has been using the app.
