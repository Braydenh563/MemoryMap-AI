"""The durable half of the job runtime (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN B2).

`core/jobs.py` is the bounded pool: lanes, widths, dedupe, the panel's rows.
It forgot everything when the process ended, which its docstring defended
("every job re-derives its result from a row that is already committed, so
the next launch can redo it"). Nothing did redo it: a folder of 200 pictures
dropped on the app, then a quit, left 150 of them without their text until
each was saved again by hand. This module is what makes the next launch
redo it.

**The shape.** A `jobs` row per queued piece of work (`DurableJob`):

- `record` writes the row when the pool queues a job whose kind has a
  handler here and whose arguments are plain data. The pool still runs the
  function object it was handed; the row is only the memory of it.
- `lease` is the worker's claim, one atomic UPDATE from `queued` to
  `running` carrying this process's `owner` token and a `lease_until`. A
  heartbeat thread renews every lease this process holds while it holds
  any, and stops when it holds none, so an idle app runs no extra thread.
- `finish` records the ending: `done`, `failed` with its reason.
- `resume`, at launch, queues again every `queued` row and every `running`
  row whose lease has lapsed (its process is gone). A lease still valid and
  owned elsewhere is a live second server on the same file (a direct
  uvicorn start skips `core/instance_lock.py`): it is left alone and looked
  at again when the lease would have run out, which is what a lease is for.

**Handlers are named, never pickled.** `HANDLERS` maps a kind to
"module:function". A row holds the kind and JSON arguments, so a notebook
cannot be made to run code by editing its database, and a function that was
renamed fails one job with a sentence rather than the launch. A job queued
with any other function (a test's stand-in, a lambda) runs exactly as
before and is simply not remembered: `durable_kind` compares the function's
own dotted name with the table's.

**A poison job stops.** A row is tried at most `MAX_ATTEMPTS` times. A job
that takes the process down with it (a native crash in Tesseract) would
otherwise crash every launch after it, which is the one way durability can
make an app worse than forgetting.

**Cancel** stops a queued job (the row goes to `cancelled` and the worker's
lease then fails). A running job is not interrupted, for the reason
`core/bgtasks.py` gives: Python cannot stop a thread safely, and the work
writes to a notebook someone cares about. The answer says so.

**Bookkeeping never breaks the job**, the rule `core/jobruns.py` set: every
write here is wrapped, and a failure costs the durability of one job, never
the job. With no app database (a script, most tests) nothing is recorded.
