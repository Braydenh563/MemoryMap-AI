"""The Library's and the Timeline's long lists stay smooth while they grow.

Measured on a thousand-note seed (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/libtlscroll.js`,
libtl-0926): a chunk of Library cards landing mid-scroll took 45 to 88ms
and the Timeline dropped a dozen frames per 120 wheel steps. Four causes,
each pinned here, because each one is a small edit away from coming back and
nothing else in the suite scrolls a thousand rows.
