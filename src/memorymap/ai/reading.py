"""One typed reading per input (CHAT_PLAN "The deterministic foundation",
module 2; decisions 47 to 49).

`read(text, *, now, context)` is the one parse chat, search, quick add and the
palette share: the `Reading` says what the words are (an act with its slots, a
utility, a question with its window, small talk, nothing), the spans
`recognise` read in them, how sure the reading is, and which reader decided.
No surface parses twice; `GET /read` serves it to the page (Brief 66's chips).

Confidence decides behaviour (decision 48), by the bands in `BANDS`:

- sure: act, or answer;
- likely: act, and say what was read (`Reading.said`);
- unsure: ask one question naming both readings, or the one missing slot
  ("Remind you when?"), never a guess (`Reading.question`);
- none: the repair ladder (`repair`, decision 49).

Nothing here reads a date or a unit itself: every such word is a span from
`ai/recognise.py` (decision 46; `tests/test_one_reader.py`).
