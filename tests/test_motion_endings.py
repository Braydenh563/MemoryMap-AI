"""Nothing waits on an animation or a transition that may never run.

**Why this exists (the review of 2026-09-27).** The owner has reduced motion
on, and under it the stylesheet stops transitions outright (`transition-
duration: 0s`, `tests/test_motion_tokens.py`) and several rules write
`animation: none`. Neither starts anything, so neither ends: an
`animationend` or `transitionend` listener on such an element never fires.
Measured on `flashSaved` (settings-wiring.js), the ring a keyboard save
draws on the control it pressed: `.just-saved` carries `animation: none`
under the system hint, so the class and the inline `--just-saved-rest` it
wrote stayed on the button for good, and every Ctrl+S added one more
listener that would never run.

The rule: a listener for the end of an animation or a transition sits next
to something that finishes the job without it, within the same function: a
timer, a check that anything is running (`getAnimations`), or the
reduced-motion test (`reducedMotionWanted`, `prefers-reduced-motion`). The
listeners that only re-check something (`avatars.js`'s companion, which is
also driven by the class change that starts the move) are named below.
