"""Every control dock follows the dock grammar (UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md, Phase 8).

A dock is the control row at the top of a tab or sub-tab. The plan states one
grammar for all of them, identity, then find, then arrange, then actions , 
and this lint holds the parts of it that can be read from the markup:

- **Zone order.** Whatever zones a dock has appear in the order identity →
  find → arrange → actions, and each at most once.
- **One primary.** At most one filled button (a `<button>` with neither
  `ghost` nor `icon-only`) per dock. A second filled button is the "two
  answers to what this row is for" defect the plan names. "In the dock" here
  means the same thing the stylesheet means by it: a direct child of a zone,
  the run of controls `.dock > * > button` sizes. A clickable chip nested
  further in (the Chat header's model badge and context pill live inside the
  headline, as metadata you can press) is not in that run and is not a
  primary; keeping the lint and the stylesheet on one definition is what
  stops the two drifting.
- **Settings live in menus.** No checkbox or radio directly in a dock zone, 
  a switch is a setting, and belongs in a popover or in Settings. Inside a
  `.dock-menu` they are fine (that is what the View menu is for).
- **Utilities in a fixed order, last.** Within `.dock-actions`, after the
  primary: refresh, help, more: never help before refresh, never the kebab
  before either. A utility is recognised by its id (`*-refresh`,
  `*-help-toggle`) or class (`dock-more`).
- **The page head, quiet facts, a quiet field, one trailing group** (INBOX
  621, the owner: the bars "dont feel professional or modern and more
  demo/vibe coded"). The one filled action closes the row: it is the last
  control of `.dock-actions`, after every utility. Icon-only buttons stand
  in that zone only, after its worded ghosts, so they read as one trailing
  group rather than icons scattered among the zones. Every search box in a
  dock is a `.search-field.dock-search` with its leading
  `.search-field-icon`. And the stylesheet draws no hairline between zones
  (the title boxed off by one, every zone fenced by another) and no edge or
  fill round a count (`.dock-chip` is quiet muted text).
- **No text-only segmented controls in a zone.** A `.seg`/`.segmented-control`
  in a dock zone must carry an icon per option or be inside a menu; the plan
  keeps segments for *view* and gives them icons. A segment's own cells are
  not counted as primaries: the fill on a segment *is* its selected state,
  not a call to action, so "one primary" is about the buttons beside it.

Like the other frontend lints this cannot see the DOM; `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/
docks.js` measures the same docks against a running app (one height per
dock, ≤ 7 visible controls per row). Docks join the lint by carrying
`data-dock-name="<name>"`, so a surface that has not been brought onto the grammar
yet is not failed for it, the ratchet is the count of docks that carry it.
