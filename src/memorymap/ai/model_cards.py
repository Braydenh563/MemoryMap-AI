"""What a Settings model card says about a model (INBOX 444).

The Models screen's "Suggested downloads" was 31 rows of ``name ~size purpose``
and 29 identical Download buttons. A person choosing hardware they already own
needs four things the list never said: how much memory the model asks for,
what it is good at, whether it fits *this* computer, and which one to start
with. The catalogue (`model_manager.SUGGESTED_MODELS`) stays the hand-kept
list of names, sizes and purposes; this module derives the rest from it, in
one place with tests, so the page does not guess.

Everything here is an estimate and says so. Memory is counted in system RAM;
a GPU with enough video memory runs the same model faster, and this does not
measure one. The fit verdict is "would this plausibly run", not a benchmark.

Also here: `inspect_model_name`, the check behind "Download another model".
It is pure (no network, because the app draws its settings offline): it says
what a typed name *is* (an Ollama library model, a community model on
ollama.com, or a Hugging Face GGUF repository that Ollama pulls through
`hf.co/`) and refuses what Ollama could not pull, so the person is told before
a download starts rather than by a failed one.
