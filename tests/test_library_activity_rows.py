"""Library Activity reads as a log, in words, and the Bin's tick clears the
card's menu (INBOX 426 z, images 89 to 91).

Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/libactivity.js` at 1440: in the grid an
activity row's detail was 11px wide (the masonry dealt one-line records into
17rem columns), a settings record read "notificationsmutedexcept_reminders"
(markdown stripped server-side and rendered again client-side), rows with no
detail slid to x 1227 in Rows, and the Bin's tick sat 4px from the ⋯ in the
grid and over the date in Rows. After: 0 narrow previews, keys in words
("Mute notifications except reminders: off"), the tick 6px from the ⋯ and
over nothing in both views. The server half is in tests/test_library.py.
