"""The perf budget, in CI (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN H9, row 27): the routes a boot and
the first clicks call, each with a budget, so a regression fails the build
like a lint rather than being found by a person a month later.

**Two numbers per route.** Statements against the database, which do not
depend on the machine: a route that starts loading every note one at a time
(the N+1 the 2026-10-03 performance pass took `/entries/reference-counts`
from 242 statements down to 6 for) fails here on any runner. And wall time,
generous enough for a busy CI runner and a sandbox at load 20, so it fails
only on a slowdown nobody could miss. The statement budgets were measured on
this notebook (300 notes, 5 documents, 20 reminders) and given room for a
statement or two of honest growth; raising one needs a reason in its
comment, the way the gzip caps do.

`boottime.js` and the per-action sweeps stay the browser's half; this is the
half every push runs.
