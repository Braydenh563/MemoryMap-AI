"""Bookmarks says what it is once (INBOX 464 (19)).

The lede under the dock ("Save links to websites you visit often: a bookmark
shelf that lives in the notebook instead of the browser") and the empty state
under it ("Add a website to keep it a click away.") said the same thing one
above the other. The lede stays, because it is there with a full list too;
the empty state is its title and its one action.
