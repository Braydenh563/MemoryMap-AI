"""The app asks no other host for anything (the owner, 2026-10-05: "make
sure it is fully local and doesnt use any external libraries that arent
vendored").

No CDN, no remote font, no analytics, no remote image: every script,
stylesheet and font is under `frontend/`, and the CSP (`core/security.py`)
names no host at all. This reads what is served (comments stripped, as
`api/asset_strip.py` serves it) for every `http(s)://` address and fails on
one that points anywhere but this machine, unless it is one of the kinds
below, which are text rather than requests:

- XML namespaces (`http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` and friends): an identifier,
  never fetched;
- a link the person follows on purpose (`<a href=... target="_blank">` in
  the page: the "Get it from ollama.com" link);
- an example in a field's placeholder, and the address a person types being
  normalised (`https://${raw}`).

The vendored libraries are read for a request built into them
(`fetch("http...`, `importScripts("http...`, a `src`/`loadPath` set to an
address). The one there is listed with why it never fires.

`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/fe1005-offline.js` is the browser half: it visits
every tab in a French locale and lists any request to another origin (none,
2026-10-05).
