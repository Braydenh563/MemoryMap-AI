"""The composed answer to a topic asked about as a whole (INBOX 787).

The owner: "the composer is still pretty barebone, has no life to it and I
may as well just ignore it and use the matching records". Asked "games notes"
it quoted two sentences and a picture's caption as "shows The image shows
...". The overview answers in its first sentence (how many notes, over which
days, the thread most share), groups the notes by that thread with a day and
a short line each, says a picture as what it shows and one line of its
words, names what links the notes, and offers what to ask next; every
clause is still a quote, a measured value, a word of the question or a word
of the notes (`tests/_composer_eval.trace_failures`).
