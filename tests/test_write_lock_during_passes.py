"""No model call inside a write transaction (audit 2026-10-05, ARCH-01).

Measured before this: during `POST /night/run` against a fake server that
took 2.5 s a round, three `POST /entries` each failed with a 500 after
5.1 s, SQLite's busy timeout. The night pass added and flushed its
`NightRun` row (an INSERT, so its connection held the write lock) and then
called the model once per note with that lock still held; the entity pass
had the same shape. With a real local model each call is seconds to tens of
seconds, so "Run now" made every save fail for minutes.

The rule these tests hold: a background pass reads, releases, asks the
model, then writes in a short transaction of its own. A save made while the
model is thinking returns at once.
