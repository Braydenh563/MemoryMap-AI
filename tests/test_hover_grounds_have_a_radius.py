"""A hover ground is a shape: the element that gains one has rounded corners
(INBOX 856: "the very subtle hover highlight over this question doesnt have
rounded corners").

The browser is the real measure (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/hoverradius.js` hovers
every link-like element, its four ancestors and its pseudo-elements on each
surface and reports a gained ground with four square corners: 0 on the
dashboard, notes (Your notes, Ask with an answer, Questions), chat, timeline,
reminders, library, graph, the palette, the guide and Settings, with data).
This is the cheap half the suite can run: every stylesheet rule that gives a
`:hover` ground to a row-like class must find a `border-radius` somewhere for
that class (or its tag), or sit on the reviewed list below with its reason. A
new hover ground on a new class with no corner fails here.
