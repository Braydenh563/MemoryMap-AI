"""Relative links in the archived and live agent files resolve.

Thirty-three agent files moved from `docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/` to
`docs/roadmap/archive/agent-remaining/` (2026-10-04) one directory deeper and
kept their `../` links, so 57 of them pointed at files that are not there
(`../INBOX.md` from the archive is `archive/INBOX.md`). A file that moves
again has the same failure, so this checks every Markdown link whose target is
a relative path, in both directories.
