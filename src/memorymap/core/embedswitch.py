"""Changing the embedding model without losing search while it happens.

INBOX 700, the owner: "can you also add more embedding model options as
alternatives in the models??". The choices are `core/embedmodels.py`'s
catalogue; this is what choosing one does.

**The old way cost search for the length of a re-index.** Vectors from two
models are not comparable, so a switch saved the new setting at once and then
re-embedded every note, deleting each old vector as it went: from the first
second, every search embedded its question with the new model and found only
the notes the pass had reached, then keyword results for the rest.

**Now the new set is built beside the old one and swapped in whole.**

1. *Prepare.* The target model is made ready: an Ollama model not yet pulled
   is pulled (bytes done of bytes total), a built-in one is loaded (its first
   load downloads it).
2. *Stage.* Every note that has a vector today is embedded with the target
   into `embeddings_staged` (`database.StagedEmbedding`), in batches, with
   progress. The saved settings are untouched, so every search and every save
   in the meantime uses the old model and the old vectors.
3. *Swap.* One transaction replaces every note vector with its staged one and
   only then are the settings saved. A note written or edited after its
   staged vector was made, or with none, is embedded again afterwards with
   the model now in use, and long notes get their paragraph vectors back.

**Durable** (`core/jobstore.py`): the job is a named handler with plain-data
arguments, so a quit or a crash part-way resumes at the next launch; staged
rows already made for the same target are kept, so it picks up where it
stopped. **Stop** (`core/bgtasks.py`, the Background tasks row) ends it
between batches, drops the staged rows and leaves the old model in use: the
one outcome a stop can never have is a notebook on two models.
