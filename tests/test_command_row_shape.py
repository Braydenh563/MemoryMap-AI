"""Both command tables are tables of the same object.

The owner, INBOX 295: "I want them to be properly structured elements ...
proper objects". Reading the code before believing the brief (DOCUMENTS_PLAN
section 18) found two reasonable tables rather than a mess, but two shapes:
`DOC_COMMANDS` in documents.js carried its icon in its own `icon` field, and
editor.js's per-context lists packed theirs into the front of `label`, as a
string the row builder printed whole.

That difference was not cosmetic. It is why the eight callout commands reached
for emoji: the row builder used `textContent`, so a `ph:` token written into a
label would have printed as the literal text "ph:note Note box". And it quietly
broke the menu's own ranking, which scores `label.startsWith(query)` first: no
label started with a letter, so that branch could never fire and typing the
first word of a command ranked it no better than a keyword hit.

So: one row shape, and the icon is a field. This test reads both tables from
source, without a browser, the way `test_doc_commands.py` already reads one.
