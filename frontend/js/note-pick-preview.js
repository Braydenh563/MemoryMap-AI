// note-pick-preview.js: what the "[[" picker's preview pane shows for a note:
// a short excerpt and its first picture. Moved out of rich-picker.js
// (`richPickerLines`) into a lazy file on 2026-10-10 (the boot-script gzip
// budget, tests/test_boot_budget.py): only a "[[" row that is a note draws
// it. It rides the note panels' bundle (`LAZY_MODULES.notePanels`, preloaded
// three seconds after boot), and `editorRenderPreview` (editor.js) has
// already drawn the pane's head, so the pane is right while this loads and
// gains the excerpt a moment later.
//
// The title is said once, by the pane's head, and never again below it: a
// note a sketch saved is "Title, then the drawing with the title as its alt
// text", and every line of it flattened to text read as the title four times
// (INBOX 784). So the excerpt skips a line equal to the title, a line that is
// only a picture, and a line it has already shown.
