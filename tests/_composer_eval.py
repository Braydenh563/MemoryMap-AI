"""The composed answer's eval (INBOX 725): 25 questions over the showcase notebook.

Not a test module (no `test_` prefix): `tests/test_composer_eval_725.py` holds
the gates and `python -m tests._composer_eval` prints the table the report
quotes. The fixture, `fixtures/composer/showcase_725.json`, is the notebook
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/seed-showcase.py` writes, read back from its database,
with the notes `/chat/stream` retrieved for each question on that notebook
(ranked, the connected ones marked), so the eval runs the composer on what
the route hands it, deterministically and with no server and no network.

Four measures, each a number:

- **grounded**: the share of an answer's factual parts (quotes, note names,
  measured values, words of the question) that trace back to the notes or the
  question. The rule says 1.0, always.
- **redundancy**: the most two quoted sentences of one answer share (token
  Jaccard over stems). A chat answer does not say a thing twice.
- **readability**: mean words per sentence of the answer as read (markdown
  marks off), and how many different joining phrases it uses.
- **first line**: whether the answer's first line answers the question's
  shape on its own: a figure for a count, a date for a when, the newest day
  and its words for a status, a quote for everything else, a measured count
  or the list for a list.
