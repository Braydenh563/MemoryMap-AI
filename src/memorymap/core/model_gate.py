"""Interactive model calls go first (audit 2026-10-05, ARCH-09).

A local model runner serves one request at a time. The background work that
calls it (the night pass, entity extraction, captions, vision reading, a
deferred filing) used to start its next call whenever it was ready, so a chat
turn asked while an import of two hundred pictures was being captioned waited
behind as many of those calls as reached the runner first, with nothing on
screen to say why.

**Priority, not exclusion.** This is a counter of interactive calls in flight
(a chat turn holds it for its whole stream) and a wait for background work to
take *between* its calls: background work yields until no interactive call is
running, so a person waits at most for the one background call already in
flight. Nothing here holds a lock across a model call, so there is nothing to
deadlock: an interactive call never waits on this module, and a background
call that waits gives up after `MAX_YIELD_SECONDS` rather than starving.
