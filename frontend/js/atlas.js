// atlas.js: Atlas, the assistant's own character. Loaded straight after
// avatars.js, whose `registerCharacter` it answers through; every other file
// reaches it by the old names (`atlasMark`, `setAtlasMood`,
// `atlasRestingMood`), so no call site changed when it moved here.
//
//: **The design note.** Atlas is a small celestial spirit built from two of
//: the owner's reference sheets, by their decision: the "conceptual art"
//: pose grid for the head's features (the flame ear tufts, the face, the
//: chest constellation, the comet tail, the nebula strand, the orbit rings
//: with their planets, the states) and the ghostly "base concept" sheet
//: for the head's oval, the lower body and the limbs (a torso that flows
//: as one outline into soft tendril legs with no feet, tendril arms, the
//: glossy head highlight, the bright chest star) and its "comet drifter"
//: for the mane. The owner's verdicts on the drafts before this one are
//: the rules: "cool and aura", "cute but not fat baby cute", "like a
//: pokemon or Rimuru", "the arms and legs aren't properly attached", "a
//: space onion", "too alien like", "too rigid ... no smooth organic flow",
//: "lego hands", "wizard cap", "very purple and a lot of the blue is
//: missing", "it doesn't need to be a large round head".
//:
//: - **Proportions** (the companion's 64 by 92 box, one unit is one px at
//:   the companion's size). The head is a soft oval a little taller than
//:   wide, 27 by 30, from 8 to 38.4: a third of the height. No neck: it
//:   sits straight on the body. The body is small and soft, 25 wide at the
//:   belly, narrowing at the waist to 73; the main look's legs run from
//:   inside the hips to the soles' line at 90, and the feminine look has
//:   none, only a skirt of ribbons from the waist (round 6); the arms are
//:   18 long from a shoulder inside the chest, just under the chin. The eyes are 10 wide, 37% of the head,
//:   13 apart, set 63% down the head; the mouth 90% down.
//: - **One silhouette, all curves** (the owner: "no smooth organic flow or
//:   shape ... all too rigid"). Every shape is cubic Beziers with matching
//:   tangents at the joins, no straight segments and no corners. Every
//:   limb, lock, wisp and the tail is a tapered stem generated from a
//:   centreline (`atlasStem`): thick where it grows out of the body, fine
//:   and soft at the tip, its root well inside the body. All outlines are
//:   drawn first as one layer (`atl-edges`) and every fill on top
//:   (`atl-fills`), so where parts overlap the fills close the seams and
//:   the figure has one outer contour; the "outline" is a soft, wide
//:   glow in the sky-blue light colour at low opacity (the owner: "not
//:   organic and more like a doll or puppet"), a subsurface light round
//:   the whole silhouette rather than a drawn line, so the gradients do
//:   the modelling; only the tiny icon keeps a real line. Each limb is in both layers
//:   under the same companion class, so a pose turns outline and fill
//:   together about a joint inside the body.
//: - **The ears, the wisps and the mane.** Two soft flame tufts, one each
//:   side of the crown, that sweep up and out with two small tongues
//:   flicked along the outer edge, an inner ear of galaxy and a star at
//:   the tip (the feminine ones longer, with a wisp trailing down beside
//:   the cheek); a small tuft of three wisps on the crown between them;
//:   and behind them a mane that starts as wide as the crown and streams
//:   back and down in layered, overlapping locks, each broad at the root
//:   and tapering to a soft point along a long S, never straight and
//:   never upward, translucent with speckle stars and a lighter leading
//:   edge (three locks for the masculine look, five longer ones flowing
//:   further down for the feminine).
//: - **The tail.** From the lower back, a flame: it thickens then tapers
//:   along an S, with small tongues flicked off its edge, the body's blue
//:   running into navy galaxy with star dots along it and a bright white
//:   comet glow at the tip. The feminine tail runs longer with a second
//:   curve. It is the companion's tail too: it lies along a ledge when
//:   Atlas sits, hangs when it hangs, curls when it sleeps and wags when
//:   it is pleased. Since INBOX 601 its root is inside the lower body and
//:   it is widest where it leaves, in the body's colour, deepening into the
//:   galaxy along its length; in the layered figure it bends along its
//:   whole length by what it is doing (`atlasTailFrame`).
//: - **The signature.** A faded constellation inside the chest and belly:
//:   a few small dim stars joined by hairlines, each in a soft glow, the
//:   heart among them only a little brighter (round 6: "they should be
//:   faded constelations"; the four-point star is gone). Three thin
//:   concentric rings of light orbit the head at cheek level, tilted,
//:   passing behind the head and in front of the chin, with a tiny planet
//:   or star glint on each. And the nebula: one ribbon of deep navy with
//:   violet and pink clouds and star dots that sweeps behind the body from
//:   the upper right and curls round under it, in a haze of soft clouds,
//:   all of it behind the figure, light and secondary (round 6; it used to
//:   cross once in front of the legs). Restraint: nothing else.
//: - **Material.** Soft and painterly: one radial gradient in the drawing's
//:   own space (a sky-blue-white core at the forehead through periwinkle
//:   to a blue-violet shade and deep blue at the far rim) fills head,
//:   mane, body and limbs alike, so the light falls on the whole figure at
//:   once; a lighter belly, as if lit from inside; a rim shade per part (a
//:   radial gradient, clear in the middle and violet at the edge, so each
//:   part rounds off); a glossy specular on the head's upper left and a
//:   smaller one on the body (white through a radial fade); a few specks
//:   inside; a subtle aura. No filters anywhere: every glow is a radial
//:   gradient.
//: - **Palette, sampled** (k-means over the reference sheets' regions,
//:   `scratchpad/palette.py`; the owner: "they are very purple and a lot of
//:   the blue is missing"). The body is blue: a sky-blue-white core
//:   (#c8e1f7, the forehead's largest cluster), periwinkle (#a3bbea, the
//:   torso's), blue-violet shade (#7d91cf) and deep blue at the far side
//:   (#505aac, the legs'). Violet only where the references have it: the
//:   ear and hair tips (#413b94, the hero's crest) and the lilac nebula
//:   (#b098d6). Navy for the eyes (#081241) and the galaxy (#1c235a);
//:   white-blue for highlights and starlight (#e7f6fd). Fixed in the CSS;
//:   the live `--accent` tints only the aura, the rings' glow and the
//:   iris's foot, never the body.
//: - **Face.** Big rounded eyes, the iris deep navy-violet filling nearly
//:   the whole eye and lightening toward its foot, centred by default, two
//:   catchlights always at the upper left and one tiny sparkle; a fine
//:   lash line; soft lower lids; faint brows; a small closed smile at rest
//:   (open only pleased or laughing); soft cheeks with blush. Fifteen
//:   moods, each a combination of all of these plus head tilt, body
//:   squash, ear, hair, tail and ring lift and star brightness and one
//:   small extra (sparkles, hearts, a thought, a tear). The combinations
//:   are CSS (`[data-atlas-mood]` in 08-consistency.css); this file draws
//:   the parts and says which mood.
//: - **Life.** Breathing squash and stretch from the feet, blinks with an
//:   occasional double blink, the tail swaying (wagging when pleased) with
//:   its starlight glinting, the tendril tips drifting, dust drifting round
//:   the rings, a slow head sway and the glow pulsing. All of it is CSS
//:   transform and opacity on this one SVG, runs only while the mark is on
//:   screen and motion is on, slows under Reduce motion and stops under
//:   Avatar animation Off. The companion's figure (INBOX 540, 554, 564,
//:   575) adds a rig: jointed arms eased on springs between the poses the
//:   CSS names (`atlasRig`), a lid that sweeps down for a blink
//:   (`atlasBlink`), the lower body's pose for what it is doing
//:   (`ATLAS_LOWER_STATES`), the hair on a layer that trails the sway and a
//:   wave down her tail.
//: - **Sizes.** `full` (a figure with margins, 96px and up: the welcome,
//:   the large view), `figure` (the companion's 64 by 92 box, parts named
//:   for the companion's behaviours), `head` (the head, its ears and a
//:   shorter cut of the mane, 28 to 95px: the dashboard mark, chat heads,
//:   persona rows) and `tiny` (under 28px: head, ears and eyes, thicker
//:   lines, no lids, brows or motion).

//: The moods Atlas can show. `cue` is what the corner companion is told when
//: Atlas moves into it (think, cheer, startle or rest); the words are the
//: mark's tooltip.

//:   the pose changes, the elbow 80ms, the wrist 130ms, and the hand
//:   trails a fast swing (overlapping action);
//: - gestures are joint targets: a wave lifts the forearm, pointing and
//:   reaching straighten the arm, an arm brought across the body folds at
//:   the elbow, a lifted arm bends a little; the elbow keeps to 0 to 135
//:   degrees, the wrist to 35 either way;
//: - while it travels the arms swing in counter-phase, the elbows easing
//:   on the back swing;
//: - the head steadies itself through a change of pose: it lags the body
//:   by a spring and catches up (`atl-head-lag`).
//: It runs only while something is moving (a pose or mood change, a
//: gesture, a walk) and stops when every joint has settled, so a figure at
//: rest costs nothing. With motion off or reduced it sets each pose at
