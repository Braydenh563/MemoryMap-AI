"""Settings, Web search says what the code does, and the code still does it
(BACKLOG section 13: "a visible statement of what's true").

The '?' next to the Web search heading used to say two sentences. The privacy
properties lived in the README and in code comments, so someone deciding
whether to turn search on had to already know where to look. The popover now
lists them, and this test holds both halves: every claim the popover makes is
checked against the module it describes, so the copy cannot drift into a
promise the code stopped keeping.
