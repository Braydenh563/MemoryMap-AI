// wiring.js: offline badge, writing room and help wiring, pickers, the find
// bar, the graph's phone sheet, [[, duplicates. Moved out of app.js on
// 2026-09-26 as one contiguous range (INBOX 426 cc,
// docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/appjs-split.md). A classic script sharing
// app.js's globals, loaded in app.js's old order; nothing in an earlier file
// calls into it while the page loads (scratchpad/appjs-map.js --check).

// --- offline badge -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// Being offline is not an error here, the app is built to run that way. What
// the badge says is narrower: web search and any cloud model will not answer
// right now. `navigator.onLine` is the browser's own answer and is only ever
// a hint (it reports "online" for a machine on a LAN with no route out), but
// a false negative is impossible and a false positive costs nothing, which is
// the right way round for a passive indicator.

//: by a day with Shift.
//: **Undo the nudges** (the owner at release: "is it possible to cancel or
//: reset any adjustments made with the buttons in this reminders bar?").
//: The steppers keep a running total; a Reset button beside them appears
//: once it is non-zero and moves the time back by exactly that much. Typing
//: a date or time, or saving, starts the total again.
