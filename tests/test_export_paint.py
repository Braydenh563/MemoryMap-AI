"""A board or map exported as a picture is painted in the colours on screen.

The owner, 2026-09-24: "I exported a mindmap selection as an image to the
library, the mindmap nodes turned white??" `wbBuildExportSvg` drew every
topic and card as `#ffffffee` with `#1f2430` ink, the light theme's look, and
forced every branch to `fill="none"` with a grey stroke. Measured with
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/exportcolours.js` in dark mode: topics 30,30,28 on
screen and 240,240,239 in the PNG, a text box's ink 236,235,232 on screen and
31,36,48 in the PNG. After: the same pixels in both, light and dark.

The suite cannot rasterise, so this holds the shape: the builder reads each
box's paint off the live element, and the old constants are fallbacks only.
