"""A note's properties: the `---` block at the top of its text (GRAPH_PLAN KG4).

The note's text is the source of truth, written the way Obsidian writes it,
so an imported vault keeps its properties and an exported note carries them.
`EntryProperty` is only an index of this, rebuilt on every save.

**Read with the documents' reader.** `core/docmeta.properties` already reads
the subset every editor in the plan's table writes (`key: value`, inline and
block lists, quotes) with its own bounds; this module adds only where the
block ends, so the rest of the app can skip it (a note opening with
properties is named by its first line after them), and a writer.

**The writer rewrites the block and never the body.** A person editing a
property changes the lines between the fences; every character after the
closing fence is copied as it was. A value that would not read back as
itself unquoted (a colon, a leading quote or bracket, a `#`) is quoted.
