"""INBOX 607: a mind map made from the graph is built from the graph.

The owner: "this is how it made the map, surely there's a better and more
dynamic way it can build the map based off the connections and links and
relevancy etc??" (one root, 33 children in a column), and "the notification
included no link to it". The tree: a central note as the root, linked notes
under the note they link to, what is not linked grouped by category, an
overfull hub split by category, and every link that does not fit the tree
kept as a cross-link. Laid out on both sides, balanced by weight.
