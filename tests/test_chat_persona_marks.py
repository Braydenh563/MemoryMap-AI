"""Each assistant reply wears the face of the persona that wrote it.

The owner: "if different personas are used in different chats for the chat
messages the avatars need to persist for what persona was used." Before this,
every assistant bubble drew the app's emblem and read its name off the live
persona picker, so switching persona relabelled every reply already on the
page, and a reopened chat claimed the current persona wrote all of it.

The suite cannot open a browser, so these hold the DOM-shaped facts as text:
the bubble builder takes the persona, both paths hand it one, the live path
captures it once and saves it with the turn, and nothing reads the picker to
name a reply after the fact. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/personamarks.js` measures
the rendered marks.
