"""Open questions (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I3, H2; row 7).

Every question a note asks in passing is a `derived_facts` row of kind
`question` (the night pass, `ai/facts.py`). This module says what state each
one is in and lets the person change it:

- **answered**, when a later note answers it: either the night pass found
  the answer (an `answered` row whose payload names this question, pass 5),
  or the person marked it by hand and named the note;
- **dropped**, when the person says it no longer matters;
- **open** otherwise.

**The state lives on the question's own payload and on the pass's rows, no
new table** (I3's "Data": "payload `{answered_by, dropped}`; no new table").
An answer the pass found stays an `answered` row with its own provenance
(which model, when, the sentence); reopening such a question tombstones that
row, the same "dismiss, and never work this out again" every derived fact
has, so the pass does not hand the same answer back next night.

**The answered-by link** (I3, decided 2026-10-04; HISTORY, "row 7"): the view links
each answered question to the sentence that answers it, in its note. A typed
link between the two notes (`context`, "answers: ...") is written only when
the person marks a question answered by hand: the night pass never writes to
the graph unasked, as it never writes to a note (I1).
