// document should be creatable "of any filetype though it should default to
// md".
//
// The table comes from `GET /documents/file-types` rather than being written
// out here, and that is not tidiness. Indenting and comment-toggling happen
// inside a keydown handler and cannot wait for a round trip, so the frontend
// genuinely needs the whole table, which means either fetching it or keeping
// a second copy. A second copy is a second thing to update, and the failure
// mode of the two disagreeing is Ctrl+/ inserting the wrong comment marker
// into someone's file. So: fetched once, cached here.

// For most of this file's life the document *was* a `<textarea>`: forty-odd
// places spelled an edit as `$("doc-content").value.slice(...)` and a caret as
// `.selectionStart`, and that was fine while there was exactly one kind of
// box. Phase 2 puts CodeMirror 6 under the same editor, and a CodeMirror view
// has neither of those properties. The failure mode of getting this wrong is
// the quietest one this codebase has: the textarea stays in the DOM as the
// fallback, so every stale read *works*, it just answers with the text as it
// was before the real editor took over. Autosave then writes the old document
// back over the new one and nothing logs a thing.
//
// So: one adapter, and `tests/test_doc_surface.py` fails the build if a call
// site goes round it. `docSurface()` answers for whatever the document is
// being edited in right now; `textareaSurface(el)` wears the same interface
// over any other box (the note composer, the note edit form, a live-view
// paragraph), which is what lets the formatting toolbar, the "/" menu and the
// completion popup keep one implementation across all of them.
//
// **The interface is the plan's, plus the textarea's own names as aliases,
// and the aliases are deliberate.** `text` / `selection()` / `setSelection` /
// `replaceRange` / `onChange` / `coordsAt` / `focus` / `scrollTop` / `lineAt`
// are what the plan specifies and what new code should use. But the shared
// helpers in this file and in editor.js are written in `value` and
// `selectionStart`, they are correct, they are covered, and rewriting every
// line of them in the same commit that changes what is underneath is exactly
// how a refactor this size loses a case. The aliases mean those helpers
// become surface-agnostic by *receiving a surface instead of an element*,
// with no edit to their bodies: one small reviewable change each rather than
// forty rewritten expressions.

// themselves", and it asks for two things: a palette listing every editor
// action with its shortcut, and a `?` shortcut sheet "generated from the same
// table so the two cannot disagree". This is that table.
//
// **The decision the plan left open, taken here because it had to be.** The
// plan names `Ctrl+K`, written before this app had a command palette of its
// own on exactly that chord (`openPalette`, app.js). Two palettes on one key
// is the collision the agent palette's own comment already records being
// caught twice. So the editor's commands *join* the palette the app has, in a
// group of their own, offered only while a document is actually open and on
// screen; the chord stays where every other surface's commands already live.
// A reader who presses Ctrl+K in a document now finds the document's own
// actions at the top of the list they already know, rather than a second list
// they have to learn.
//
// **A row whose action already has a button runs the button.** Not a copy of
// its handler: a copy is a second definition of what "Export as HTML" means,
// and the two drift the first time one is edited. The table carries the
// control's id and the run is a click, which is also why every one of these
// is reachable at all: a command that pointed at a function the dock no
// longer calls would look right here and do nothing.

// read the table's shape without a browser.

// DOC-COMMANDS-BEGIN

//: Pressing a control that is in a closed `<details>` menu still works (the

// detection and ctrl + / commenting or equivalent as well as indenting and
// dedenting". All three are keystroke-level, which is why the file-type table
// is fetched and cached rather than queried, see `loadDocFileTypes`.
//
// Built on the existing textarea rather than on a third-party code editor.
// This app has no build step (`frontend/app.js` is served as-is), so a real
// editor component would mean either a vendored bundle or a CDN, and the
// three behaviours that were actually asked for are a few dozen lines each
// against a textarea. What is genuinely lost by not using one is syntax
// *colouring*, which needs a tokeniser per language; that is a separate
// decision with a real dependency behind it, and pretending otherwise by
// half-highlighting a few keywords would look worse than plain monospace.

//: Every gutter in the document, paired with the textarea it numbers. The
//: documents editor's gutter is the original (`#doc-gutter` beside

// --- Live preview: the same editor, with decorations on -----------------------
//
// ROADMAP item 0, asked for again directly: "the notion/obsidian live md
// rendering after typing hybrid kind of md". The model both of those use, and
// the one implemented here: **the document renders in place, and the markdown
// markers hide themselves until the caret enters the thing they mark.** So
// `**bold**` is bold while you read it and `**bold**` while you edit it, and
// you never lose sight of the syntax you are actually typing.
//
// **What this replaces, and why it had to.** Until Phase 2 the Live view was a
// second editor: one `<textarea>` per paragraph, the rest of the document
// rendered to HTML beside them, the whole pane rebuilt whenever the prose
// check ran. It worked, and it was honest about its own limits, but the cost
// was structural. Measured in Chromium on the plan's own 20k-word document
// (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/doctype.js`): a single keystroke in Live produced
// 1,178 markdown renders and a keydown p50 of 160 ms against a 30 ms gate,
// because every debounced prose pass tore down and rebuilt every block in the
// document. There is no tuning that fixes that shape; the pane has to stop
// being a thousand elements.
//
// Decorations are the fix and they are also the better editor. One document,
// one caret, one selection, one undo history, no block boundaries to fall
// between, and only the *visible* lines are ever decorated
// (`view.visibleRanges`), so the work per keystroke is a screenful rather than
// a document. It is Obsidian's own architecture, which is what was asked for.
//
// **What is lost, said plainly:** the Notion-style block handle, its drag to
// reorder and its move/duplicate/delete menu went with the block DOM. Those
// were real and people used them. DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 3 is where block
// structure comes back, as gutter affordances over the one document rather
// than as a second copy of it.

// =============================================================================
// Tables, as a model over the markdown rather than a second document
// (DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 3 item 1)
// =============================================================================
//
// **The gate this is written for, first, because it decides the whole shape.**
// PLAN D4: a table edited in Live and then read in Source has to be the
// markdown a person would have typed, byte for byte. The obvious
// implementation, parse the table into a grid and print it back out, fails
// that gate on its first keystroke: a hand-aligned table comes back with its
// padding rebuilt, a ragged one comes back tidied, and a cell holding `\|`
// comes back holding whatever the printer decided to do about pipes. The
// document is then no longer the file its author wrote, which is the one
// promise a markdown editor makes.
//
// So nothing here ever *prints a table*. Every operation returns a list of
// `{from, to, insert}` edits in document coordinates, each one covering the
// smallest span it can: setting a cell rewrites that cell's own characters
// between its pipes and nothing else; adding a column inserts one `|` and one
// cell per line; alignment rewrites one delimiter cell. Every byte the
// operation did not have to touch is still the byte the author typed, which
// is a stronger statement than "the output matches the input" and is what
// `tests/test_doc_tables.py` measures: it applies an operation and its
// inverse and compares the result to the original string.
//
// The parse is byte-exact by construction for the same reason: a row is kept
// as its indent, whether it had a leading pipe, the raw text of each cell
// *including its padding*, and whatever followed the last pipe.
// `docTableJoinRow(docTableSplitRow(line)) === line` for every line, which the
// test asserts over the awkward shapes (a pipe escaped inside a cell, a table
// with no outer pipes, mismatched column widths, an indented table).
//
// This region is bracketed by `DOC-TABLE-BEGIN` / `DOC-TABLE-END` because the
// test runs it in node, away from the browser: it is pure string work with no
// DOM and no app globals in it, and that is a property worth keeping.

// DOC-TABLE-BEGIN

//: A delimiter cell is the `---`, `:---`, `---:` or `:---:` under a header.
//: GFM wants at least one dash; the colons are the alignment.
const DOC_TABLE_DELIM_CELL = /^[ \t]*:?-+:?[ \t]*$/;

//: How many columns the Live grid can place by class. Every cell in the
//: rendered line has to be *placed* rather than left to auto-flow, because a
//: hidden pipe leaves three zero-width children behind it (two
//: `cm-widgetBuffer` images and the replacement's own empty span) and
//: auto-flow gives each of those a column of its own: a three-column table
//: was drawn as fifteen tracks with the cells at 51.6px and the text wrapping
//: inside them (INBOX 191). The classes are generated in pairs
//: (`cm-md-cols-N` on the line, `cm-md-cN` on the cell), so the cap is only

// =============================================================================
//
// The same promise the table model makes, for the same reason: **nothing here
// ever prints YAML.** Every operation returns a list of `{from, to, insert}`
// edits in document coordinates, each one covering the value's own span and
// nothing else, so a document whose frontmatter was written by hand (or by
// Obsidian, or by this app's own vault import, which writes `category:` and
// `tags: [a, b]`) keeps its quoting, its spacing and its key order when one
// field is edited in the panel. A YAML printer would reformat the whole block
// on the first keystroke, and a notebook whose files come back rewritten every
// time somebody edits a tag is a notebook whose diffs are noise.
//
// The parse is deliberately small, and small is not the same as sloppy: it
// understands `---` on line 1, `key: value` lines until the closing `---`, and
// values that are scalars (quoted or not), inline lists (`[a, b]`) or block
// lists (`- a` on the lines under the key). Anything it does not understand is
// left alone rather than guessed at: an unparsed line keeps its bytes and the
// panel simply offers no field for it, which is the only behaviour that cannot
// lose someone's text.
//
// Bracketed by `DOC-FRONTMATTER-BEGIN` / `DOC-FRONTMATTER-END` so
// `tests/test_doc_frontmatter.py` can run it in node, away from the browser:
// pure string work, no DOM and no app globals. It uses `docTableApplyEdits`
// from the table region, because there is one way to apply a list of edits to

// The properties panel: the model above, as fields
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **Why this is DOM outside the editor rather than a widget inside it.** A
// `Decoration.replace` from a view plugin may not contain a line break:
// CodeMirror throws "Decorations that replace line breaks may not be specified
// via plugin" and the whole view stops updating. Frontmatter is three lines at
// the very least, so the panel cannot be a block widget over it. It is built
// here and inserted as the first child of `#doc-editor`, which is a flex
// column, so it sits above the view and shares its column. (Not as a sibling
// *before* `#doc-editor`: `.doc-source-wrap` is a flex **row**, because the
// line-number gutter sits beside the text, so a sibling there would be a
// column to the left of the writing rather than a panel above it.)
//
// The frontmatter lines themselves hide in Live the way a table's delimiter
// row does: one `Decoration.line` per line with `height: 0` plus a per-line
// `hide()`, and each of those replacements is inside a single line, which is
// what makes them legal from a plugin.
//
// **Writes happen on `change`, not on `input`**, and that is a decision rather
// than an oversight: `input` would put one transaction per keystroke into the
// undo history, so Ctrl+Z would take back a letter of a tag at a time, and it
// would re-enter this function mid-typing on every one of them. `change`
// fires on Enter and on blur, which is one undo step per edited value: the
// same granularity the table commands chose for the same reason.
//
// **Live only.** Source shows the YAML itself, so a panel there would be two
// editable copies of one thing on screen at once; Read renders the properties
// as a block through the preview (`renderDocPreview`). The panel is markdown
// only, because a `.py` file whose first line is `---` is not a document with

//
// **The syntax, decided here and written into the plan's decisions.**
//
// `:::columns` opens a block, `:::column` starts the next column inside it,
// and `:::` closes it. Three reasons for that shape rather than another:
// `:::` fenced divs are what Pandoc, Obsidian's community plugins and every
// markdown-it-container setup already use, so the text stays readable
// somewhere else; the opening word says what the block is rather than naming
// an id the way the multi-column plugins do; and a break that is `:::column`
// (singular) can never be confused with the `:::` that closes, which is the
// ambiguity every other candidate had.
//
// An image's options are `|`-separated and recognised by *shape*, not by
// position: `![[photo.png|300]]` is Obsidian's own width syntax and reads the
// same here, `![[photo.png|300|center]]` adds the alignment, and any option
// that is neither a number nor an alignment is the caption. Shape rather than
// order, because `![[photo.png|A river at dusk|400]]` is what people actually
// type once they know both exist, and an editor that then made the caption
// four hundred pixels wide would be obeying its grammar instead of its author.
// The same options work on a plain markdown image through its alt text,
// `![A river|400|center](/media/river.jpg)`, which is the form that travels.

// A paragraph you can link to and embed, from a note, a map node or a chat.
//
// **The syntax is Obsidian's**, and the reason is the reason the columns fence
// is Pandoc's: a document written here should still say the same thing
// somewhere else. A block carries `^an-id` at the end of its last line; a link
// to it is `[[Document title#^an-id]]` and an embed of it is the same with a
// leading `!`, which is the form the embeds built in Phase 3 already parse the
// left half of.
//
// **The id is generated, never asked for.** Obsidian asks the same way: you
// copy a link to a block and the id appears in the text. A person naming
// their own ids is a person maintaining them, and the one thing a block
// reference must survive is the paragraph being rewritten around it.
//
// Everything between the markers below is pure string work with no DOM and no

// a property the tests enforce by existing, the same way the table and

// Comments and annotations (DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 5 item 1)
// =============================================================================
//
// **The syntax is two constructs this editor already wrote, joined.**
// `==highlighted text==` has rendered as a highlight since Phase 2 and
// `%%a note to self%%` has been in the Insert menu just as long, kept in the
// file and never rendered. A comment is the pair: the highlight says *which
// words* and the `%%…%%` immediately after it says *what about them*. Nothing
// new goes into the file, so a document written here still opens in Obsidian
// (same two constructs, same meaning) and a document written there arrives
// with its comments already understood.
//
// **A bare `%%…%%` is still a comment**, on the line it sits in rather than on
// a span of words: that is what the Insert menu has always inserted, and a
// feature that made yesterday's notes to self invisible to the panel listing
// comments would be a feature that lost them.
//
// **Resolving removes the comment from the document**, and unwraps the
// highlight it was attached to, leaving the words themselves. The alternative
// (a resolved marker left in the text) was considered and refused: it is a
// second state to render, a second thing for Live and Read to agree about, and
// a file whose `%%` spans mean two different things depending on a flag
// somewhere else. What makes removal safe here is that this editor already
// keeps every version of a document (`/documents/{id}/revisions`) and the
// engine's own undo covers the keystroke, so a resolve is recoverable twice
// over.
//
// **In an export, a comment becomes a footnote** (`docCommentFootnotes`), so a
// PDF handed to somebody carries the remarks rather than dropping them. In
// Read and Split they are hidden: the document as it reads is the document
// without the margin notes in it.
//
// The model is pure string work with no DOM and no app globals, so
// `tests/test_doc_comments.py` runs it in node, the same way the table,
// frontmatter, columns and block-reference models are tested. The footnote
// conversion exists twice, here and in `src/memorymap/core/docexport.py`
// (the server exports cannot call into this file), and that test runs both
// over one fixture and asserts the two agree byte for byte.

// this editor has *one* panel width. A second vertical column at 1100px leaves
// the measure under 500px, and the sidebar is already where every "about this
// document" list lives (the outline, what links here, the notes it draws on).
// Phase 6 turns that one panel into a sheet at narrow widths, so a right panel
// would have needed a second responsive story for the same content. The phrase
// in Phase 5 item 1 is superseded by this paragraph and nothing else about it
// is.
//
// It was a third tab for one measurement's worth of time, and the measurement is
// why it is not: "Documents", "Outline" and "Comments" want 257px of label in a
// strip with 180px of content box, so the strip wrapped and stood 75px tall
// against 29px. The markup for the backlinks had already written the rule down
// ("the sidebar already has two tabs too many for the space it has"), which is
// the kind of decision this project keeps in the file it applies to precisely so
// that the next session does not have to rediscover it with a ruler.
//
// A row does its work in place, which is DOCUMENTS_PLAN 12 D3's rule for the

// a sum and a sub/superscript, which is what this does.

// "Decorations that replace line breaks may not be specified via plugin" and
// the whole view stops updating. A state field may provide one, which is
// exactly the escape hatch the library documents for block widgets, and this
// is the one construct in this editor that needs it.
//
// **The block is replaced only while the caret is outside it.** Inside, the
// fences and the two columns are the plain text you typed and every other
// decoration in Live applies to them as usual; that is the same "reveal what
// you are in" rule the rest of this view follows, one block wide instead of
// one line wide. Clicking a rendered column puts the caret at the top of that
// column, and ArrowDown/ArrowUp into the block step inside it rather than over
// it (`docColumnsArrowKeymap`), because a block you can only reach with a
// mouse is a block a keyboard user cannot edit.

// --- keeping the two panes looking at the same place --------------------------
//
// Side by side is only half of a split view. Without this, scrolling the
// editor leaves the preview showing paragraph one, so the rendered half is
// useful for the first screen of a document and decorative after that, which
// is most of what "the panes get squished together and it feels annoying to
// use" is about once they are actually side by side.
//
// **This used to be a scroll fraction, and the fraction is what was wrong.**
// The owner, 2026-09-20: "the scrolling is off in the split document view
// because of the md rendering", which names the cause exactly. A fraction
// assumes the two panes are the same document at two scales, and they are not:
// a picture is one line of source and four hundred pixels of preview, a table
// is six lines and one box, a code fence is twenty lines in both but with a
// header strip and a different line height in one of them. Every such block
// shifts everything below it in one pane and not the other, and the error is
// cumulative, so the top of a document lines up, the bottom lines up (both
// ends are exact by construction), and the middle, which is where anybody
// actually reads, is off by however much furniture is above it.
//
// So the map is line to block. `renderMarkdown` (navigation.js) stamps every block it
// draws with the source line it came from, which is the one place that can
// know; `docScrollAnchors` turns those stamps into pairs of offsets, one in
// each pane, and the sync interpolates between the two nearest. The old
// fraction is still here and still used, for the case where there is nothing
// to interpolate between: fewer than two anchors, or a textarea fallback with
// no line-to-pixel map of its own.

//: Which pane the user is actually scrolling. Without this the two feed each
//: other: A scrolls B, B's scroll event scrolls A, and the pair juddate to a
//: stop somewhere neither of them was asked to go.
let docScrollDriver = null;

//: The anchor table, rebuilt only when something that could move an anchor has
//: changed. Building it walks every block in the preview and asks the editor

//: exactly the anchors this table is built for, the ones off screen.
//: `lineBlockAt` answers from the height map, which covers the whole document.

// DOC-EXPORT-HTML-BEGIN
//: **A document as one HTML file that needs nothing else**
//: (DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 7, the decision recorded in that plan's section 13).
//:
//: The short version, because the shape of this code only makes sense with it:
//: there is no server-side markdown renderer in this app and the plan forbids
//: adding one, so the only faithful source of a rendered document is the
//: rendered document, which lives in `#doc-preview` in the browser. The export
//: is therefore built here, from that DOM, exactly the way the whiteboard's PNG
//: export is built from the canvas that is already drawn.
//:
//: "Self-contained" is the whole requirement and it is what most of this file
//: is about: the page that lands in somebody's downloads folder must open with
//: no network, no app, and no account. So the stylesheet is written out in
//: full below rather than the app's eleven sheets being inlined (they are 400KB
//: of tokens, docks and dialogs for a page with none of those in it), images
//: become `data:` URIs, icons and controls are dropped rather than shipped
//: broken, and a link that points back into this app loses its href and keeps
//: its words. `tests/test_document_export_html.py` is what holds that line.

//: Deliberately small and deliberately not the app's. The one thing it has to
//: get right is the reading measure and the vertical rhythm; everything else
//: is the browser's own defaults doing their job. Dark is a media query rather
//: than a choice, because the file has no settings in it and the reader's
//: system is the only preference there is.

//: **What changed between two versions of the same text.** Two surfaces ask
//: that question and they have to be asking it of the same object: the history
//: dialog ("what did this version say that the next one does not") and the AI
//: edit panel ("what is the model actually proposing"). A second diff written
//: for the second surface is exactly how the two would come to disagree about
//: what a change is, so there is one model here and both draw from it.
//:
//: **Lines, not words or characters.** A markdown document's unit of change is
//: a line: a paragraph is one line in this app's own documents, a list item is
//: one line, a table row is one line. A word-level diff inside a changed line
//: reads better and is deliberately not here: it needs a second model with its
//: own tokenisation and its own rendering, and the value of it is small next to
//: a first version that says which paragraphs moved.
//:
//: **No dependency, and none is needed.** The common prefix and suffix are
//: trimmed first, which is what makes the classic LCS table affordable: the
//: middle of a real edit is a few lines even in a long document. The cap below
//: is what stops the table being the size of two documents multiplied together

//: from the capture box would clear the textarea and leave the words on
//: screen.
//:
//: **The textarea is not hidden, it is laid over the view at zero opacity.**
//: `display: none` would have been simpler and wrong in two ways that only a

// of 42 typos, and treated every word that was not in it as correctly spelled.
// That is not a spell checker, it is a list of 42 strings: "tets" was never
// flagged, and neither was anything else a person actually mistypes. The
// owner's two reports are the same cause seen from two sides. "Spelling errors
// and grammar arent picked up all the time" is the table being 42 entries
// long. "No edit suggestions popup panel appears when I click on underlined
// words" is subtler and worse: the underline being clicked was not this app's,
// it was the *browser's* native squiggle, drawn because the editor carries
// `spellcheck="true"`. The app had no finding at that word, so it had nothing
// to open a menu about, and the click did nothing.
//
// So the fix has to be a real dictionary, and the browser's squiggle has to
// go once there is one, or every misspelling carries two underlines and only
// one of them answers a click. `docBrowserSpellcheck` is that switch, and it
// is deliberately conditional rather than deleted: if the word list fails to
// load, the browser's checker is better than nothing and comes straight back.

// properties copied on every resize to keep two layers of glyphs on top of
// each other, and the comment it carried recorded what happens when one of
// them is missed: the underline is right at the top of the file and a word
// out by the bottom.
//
// Phase 2 decision 5 retires it. The findings are mark decorations inside the
// engine now (`docFindingsPlugin`), which have no geometry to keep in step
// because they *are* the text, and they are drawn in every view rather than
// only in the two the backdrop could cover. What is left here is the part
// that was never about the layer: which findings are drawable at all, and
// what shape each kind gets.

//: moment the button was pressed, not what it says when the question is
//: actually asked.
//:
//: `attachedDocuments` fixes all three and it already existed, the composer
//: has staged documents as removable chips since files could be dropped into

// Undo, and where it comes from now (PLAN.md §2 D3, DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 2)
// =============================================================================
//
// **What used to be here.** A stack of whole-document snapshots, 200 deep,
// coalesced on a 500 ms window, fed from `markDocDirty` and applied as a
// minimal range edit. It existed for one reason, and the reason was the Live
// view: a `<textarea>` keeps a native undo history, but that history belongs
// to *one element*, and Live gave every paragraph its own textarea, created
// when you clicked into it and destroyed when you left. Type in Live, switch
// to Source, press Ctrl+Z, and the box you were now in had never seen the
// edit. That is PLAN D3's own acceptance line, and it was broken.
//
// **Why it goes.** Phase 2 leaves exactly one editing surface in every view.
// Where the engine is mounted, CodeMirror keeps a real history over
// transactions, which is strictly better than snapshots: it knows what
// changed rather than inferring it, it survives a view switch because there
// is no second box to switch to, and one Ctrl+Z undoes a Replace all as one
// thing. Where the engine is not mounted the surface is a single textarea
// with its own native history, and `docReplaceRange` already keeps the
// toolbar's edits inside it. Neither case has the problem the stack was
// written for, and keeping two histories fed by the same edits is the shape
// where Ctrl+Z walks one of them while the editor shows the other.
//
// What survives is the diff, because the surface adapter uses it to turn "the
// document is now this string" into the one edit that was actually made.

//: The smallest range that differs, as `[from, to, text]` against `before`.
//: Common prefix and common suffix, enough to turn a whole rebuilt document
//: into the one insertion or deletion a person made, which is what keeps a
//: caller that hands over a full string from costing the length of the
//: document and from collapsing into a single undoable rewrite.
