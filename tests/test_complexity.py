"""Complexity and import cycles, ratcheted (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 26.2, decision 63).

`scripts/complexity.py` walks `src/memorymap` for cyclomatic complexity and
import cycles. The seed `complexity_seed.json` holds every function over 15
on 2026-10-10 with the number it had (260 functions; the worst is
`_note_facts` and `_stream_lines` at 105). A function over 15 that is not in
the seed fails; a seeded function that grew fails; one that fell to 15 or
below, or went away, fails until its row is deleted, so the seed only
shrinks. Refresh a number downward with
`python scripts/complexity.py` and edit the JSON by hand.

Cycles: at load there are none and it stays none. Counting imports inside
functions there is one group of 20 modules (the AI package's lazy imports);
it may not grow.
