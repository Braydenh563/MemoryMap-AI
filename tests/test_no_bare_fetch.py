"""No bare `fetch(` outside the API door (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 10, F5).

"13 raw `fetch()` calls beside `api()`. Each re-implements the auth header,
the error contract and the offline path; one is `/chat/stream`, the most
important call in the app." Each of those had already broken once in its own
way: `/chat/stream` went a release without `X-Workspace-ID`, `/help/ask/stream`
without `X-Auth-Token`, an upload landed in the wrong space.

`api()` (app.js) is now the one door for every request to the server:

- a `FormData` body keeps the browser's multipart type instead of being
  stamped JSON, and a caller's own `headers` are merged rather than
  replacing the auth and space headers;
- it returns the `Response`, so a streamed body is still read as it arrives;
- `api.upload(path, form)` and `api.stream(path, options)` name the two
  shapes the hand-rolled calls existed for.

What remains, each with its reason, is the allowlist below; a new bare
`fetch(` anywhere else fails here.
