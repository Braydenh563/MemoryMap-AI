"""CHAT_PLAN Phase 6, the deterministic engine (Brief 39): the executable spec.

Strict-xfail until an Opus session builds each step (the contract of
tests/test_events.py and tests/test_learned_spec.py). Every test here fails
today, for the reason in its marker; when a step lands, its tests XPASS, which
strict mode turns into a failure, and the session removes that marker, and
only that marker, once the test passes on its own.

Modules that do not exist yet (`ai.factgraph`, `ai.realise`, `ai.commands`)
are imported inside the test body, so the test xfails with ImportError today
and the file always collects. Names below are the contract; a session that
needs a different shape changes the test in the same commit, with the reason.
Shared notes live in tests/fixtures/composer/phase6_seed.json (today is
2026-10-06, a Tuesday).
