"""The writing suggestions fit their own panel, and focus mode can open them
(INBOX 426 b).

The owner: "the suggestions panel doesnt adapt properly to the sidebar and
it also needs to be accessible in full screen mode". Measured in the 320px
right dock: the head was a `flex: none` row of five buttons, 415px wide, so
Dictionary and the close were cut off at the panel's edge and the panel
scrolled 222px sideways (109px at 360 wide); ten ellipsised finding halves
carried no title. In focus mode the only way in, the status bar's chip, is
one of the bands the mode hides. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/doctoolbarfit.js`
measures the geometry; these lints hold the shapes.
