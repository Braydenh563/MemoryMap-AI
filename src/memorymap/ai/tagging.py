"""Tag suggestions with no model: one engine for every path (INBOX 440, 781).

The owner: "I want the deterministic engine to be better for when suggesting
tags, both for popup suggestions, when using the 'tag and file with atlas',
and also when making a note". The three paths are the note card's kept
suggestions (`routes_entries._keep_suggestions`), Tag and file with Atlas
(`/entries/{id}/reevaluate`, and the batch act `starter_acts._tag_untagged`)
and Capture while typing (`/entries/suggest-tags`); each asks `suggest`.

What votes for a tag, all from the notebook (WORLD_CLASS 23, decisions 5 and 7):

* **the person's own vocabulary first**: only tags they already use are
  offered while they have any, each in its most used spelling;
* **its words in the note**, folded for plurals, endings and the common
  abbreviations ("stats" is #statistics, "running" is #run), counting more in
  the title and first line, where a note says what it is;
* **the nearest notes' tags** by shared rare words (TF-IDF), and the tags of
  the notes it links to;
* **less for a tag turned down often** across notes (`turned_down`), until
  the person offers it again from the tag manager.

Nothing is read from a quotation, an image's address or an OCR footer
(`clean`), and a tag is offered only where the note has a word for it
(`grounds`): the nearest notes alone gave every note near a lecture "study"
and "university" (the Study bug). Measured on `tests/fixtures/tagging/`
(`tests/test_tag_suggestions.py`).
