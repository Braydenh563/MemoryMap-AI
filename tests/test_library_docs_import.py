"""The Library's Documents list can import a file as a document (BACKLOG
section 99: "an upload documents option in the documents tab in the library").

`POST /documents/import` (tests/test_document_import.py) already turned a Word
file, PDF, spreadsheet, Markdown or code file into a Document, but only the
chat's paperclip reached it. These checks hold the door the Library now has:
the markup, the handler that talks to the route, and the two help surfaces that
name it (standing order 13: help moves with the UI). The DOM itself is
exercised by the sweep `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/bl1005-docsimport.js`.
