"""Quick, normal, detailed: one dial over the settings a turn actually needs (§11).

**The gap this closes.** The prompt side of a turn is budgeted carefully:
`ai/context.py` rations every part of the input against the model's real
window. The *output* side had one number for everything, `num_predict` was a
flat 1,024 whether the question was "when did I write about beans" or "draft me
a summary of the last month". Output tokens are generated one at a time, so
they cost far more wall-clock each than prompt tokens do: an unbounded or
over-generous reply cap is the single most common reason an answer "takes
ages", and a uniform one means every short question pays for the possibility of
a long answer.

**Why a preset rather than automatic.** Choosing settings *by task* needs a
"how hard is this turn" judgement, which is itself a model call, and it fails
by being wrong confidently rather than obviously. A preset the person picks is
honest about being a preset. Automatic routing can be layered on later; it
cannot be un-layered once someone has learned not to trust it.

**What varies, and why each one.**

- `max_output_tokens`, the direct latency lever, and the reason this exists.
- `temperature`, recalling what you wrote wants the likeliest words; drafting
  and brainstorming want room to move. Sending 0.8 for "when did I write X" is
  asking a fact question to be creative.
- `think`, reasoning models spend output tokens *before* the answer starts.
  On a quick lookup that is the whole latency budget spent on deliberation
  nobody reads.
- `length_hint`, the model has to be told, not only capped. A cap alone
  truncates mid-sentence, which reads as a crash; a hint plus a cap produces a
  short answer that ends.

**Failing closed on a model that can't.** Not every model supports a thinking
toggle, and `think` sent to one that doesn't is either ignored or an error
depending on the backend and its version. So the toggle is only ever sent when
it is being turned *off*, and only where the backend has somewhere to put it, 
turning thinking off on a model with none is a no-op either way, while turning
it on where it isn't supported is the request that fails. Sending nothing is
always the safe direction, because "nothing" means "whatever the model does by
default", which is what happened before this module existed.

    #: **Except for `think`, and that is the whole reason this exists.** Quick
    #: sends `think: False`, which is right for a lookup nobody reads the
    #: reasoning of, and it is what made the Guide's thinking box dead markup:
    #: the panel renders `.help-chat-think` from a `thinking` event that could
    #: never arrive, because the mode the turn ran in had turned thinking off
    #: at the backend. The owner, 2026-09-20: "thinking boxes dont render".
    #: `None` here means the field is never sent and the model does whatever

    #: 1,550 characters, near 520 tokens at the conservative three characters
    #: a token, which Quick's 256 cut off mid-list. 640 holds the longest
    #: entry with room over; a short question still gets a short answer,
    #: because the system prompt asks for one and the cap is a ceiling, not a
    #: target. `tests/test_help_controls.py` checks the cap against the
    #: longest entry, so a longer one raises this or fails.
