"""The Guide can answer "what are all the keys and hidden features of X".

INBOX 410, the owner: "what if the user asks the guide for all the hidden
features, keybinds, controls, utility and more for features like the
whiteboard, mindmap and documents editor etc. can it answer those??" Before
this it could not: the whiteboard entry was two sentences with no key in it,
the documents entry named three, and the shortcuts entry still taught the "g"
chord the app had replaced with "m". Each surface now has a controls entry
written from its own handlers and shortcut tables, and a question that asks
for keys, controls or hidden features about a named surface is routed to that
surface's controls entry rather than to its one-paragraph description.
