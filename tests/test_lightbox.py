"""The image viewer's layout (§ lightbox).

Reported with two screenshots after the first version of the info panel
shipped:

    "the lightbox arrow icons in are not centred, same with the caption and
     ocr text at the bottom. is the lightbox scrollable?? maybe it can have
     the image information and other info about it below the image with the
     caption and ocr text??"

All three were the same cause. `.lightbox` was a fixed, non-scrolling box with
`place-content: center`, which centres a column and then clips whatever does
not fit: at both ends. Adding a caption panel made the column taller than the
viewport, so the panel was cut off with no way to scroll to it, and the arrows
(`position: fixed; top: 50%`) were centred on the viewport rather than on an
image that was no longer in the middle of it.

These are lints: nothing here renders a page. They pin the structure that
makes the geometry correct without measuring, so it cannot silently regress
the way the JS-measured version did.
