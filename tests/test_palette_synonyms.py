"""The command palette finds a feature by the words people use for it.

Audit 2026-10-05, UX-08: Ctrl+K "questions", "backup", "undo", "bin" and
"trash" each said "No matching command, note or document.", and "theme" found
nothing (only "dark" found "Toggle light/dark"). The recycle bin's only door
was Library, Filter, "Include the bin"; Questions was a Notes sub-tab. A row
now carries `keywords`, matched with its label, and the places that had no
