"""Local OCR text extraction for uploaded images (ROADMAP.md item 30d).

A whiteboard photo or a scanned page attached via `POST /media/upload`
attaches today as an opaque file nothing reads, "what was on that
whiteboard photo from March" is unanswerable by search. This reads the
image once, in the background, and stores what it found on
`MediaUpload.ocr_text`, so the Library's Image Gallery search (client-side,
same as the rest of the Library's own search box) can find it.

`pytesseract`/Pillow (the thin Python wrapper this module imports) are
listed as the "ocr" entry in `core/extras.py`'s installable-extras
registry: pip installable, so `_run_install` handles that half exactly
like every other extra. The `tesseract` **system binary** itself is a
different problem: no PyPI wheel ships it, so `pip install` alone can
never make it appear. `attempt_binary_install` below (asked for directly:
"automate it if possible") tries the platform's own package manager
non-interactively, winget/brew/apt/dnf/pacman, and `core/extras.py`'s
`_run_install` calls it, best-effort, right after the pip half succeeds
for this one extra specifically. When neither the automated attempt nor a
manual `apt install tesseract-ocr` (INSTALL.md) has happened yet, this
degrades to "extracts nothing," logged once per process rather than once
per upload, never a failed upload, the same "never blocks or fails the
thing it's attached to" contract `ai/embeddings.py`'s own background retry
already follows.
