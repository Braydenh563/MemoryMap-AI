    default and the note's own space could not list the category it was filed
    into. Given one, both halves use it: the lookup, or a "Research" in
    another space would be reused, and the insert.

    capturing twelve notes each, 5 of 72 saves died that way, because the
    app genuinely has several writers (the desktop window, a browser tab,
    and the night shift's auto-filing all save notes).

    The insert therefore runs in a savepoint, and losing the race is treated
    as what it is: somebody else has made the category this caller wanted, so
    read theirs. The savepoint matters because without it the failed insert
    poisons the caller's whole transaction, turning a recoverable collision
    into the same 500 by a different route. The re-read is guaranteed to find

    #   the library. The pointer goes with the map; the thing it pointed at
    #   is a note, and notes are not deleted by deleting a picture of one.
    #   That distinction is the whole of `tests/test_mindmap.py`'s first test;

# back to keywords for this note" rather than as an error. They are rebuilt by
