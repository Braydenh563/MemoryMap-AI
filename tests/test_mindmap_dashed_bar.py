"""A mind map topic's Dashed edge bar has gaps on every ground (INBOX 581).

The owner, verbatim: "on the mindmap, the solid and dashed bar are exactly the
same on mind map nodes". After 569 (the pin's dash), one case was left: a
border's gaps show the element's own background, which runs under the border
by default, and a core topic's background is `--wb-branch`, the bar's own
colour, so its Dashed bar drew solid (scratchpad/ui-sweeps/gl1005-mmbar.js:
0% gap lines on a core ellipse, pill or box; 2 of 16 core cases told apart).
A dashed bar clips the ground to the padding box, and the rule has to outrank
the core and filled rules' `background` shorthand, which resets the clip.
