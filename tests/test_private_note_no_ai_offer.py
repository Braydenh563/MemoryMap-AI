"""A private note is never offered to Atlas (OPEN.md, sweep 1004 item 7).

`POST /entries/{id}/reevaluate` refuses a private note with a 400
(`test_reevaluate_private.py`), so the offers that reach it must not be drawn
for one: the note menu's "AI actions" group already carries that guard, and
the card's "Tag with Atlas" chip, which calls the same `reevaluateEntry`,
did not. It was a button whose only answer was a refusal toast.
