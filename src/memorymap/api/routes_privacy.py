"""The privacy receipt: what left this machine, read from the app's own record.

WORLD_CLASS_PLAN §2 standout 5 ("a page that proves, from the app's own
logs, that nothing left the machine; hosted competitors cannot ship this")
and §12 S6's second half ("show the configured URL in the privacy
receipt"). The record is `core/egress.py`'s audit hook, which sees every
connection and every name lookup this process makes; this route reads it,
adds the ledger kept across launches, and says in plain words the two things
the hook cannot see: the model server and a SearXNG are other programs.

Read-only apart from the ledger flush, and behind the unlock like every
data route: which hosts a notebook has talked to is itself private.
