"""Every script the app names resolves to a real file under `frontend/`.

The scripts moved from `frontend/` into `frontend/js/` (2026-10-03). A path
written in three places can drift in three ways and nothing else would see it:
a `<script src>` in index.html that 404s stops the app booting; a
`LAZY_MODULES` entry that 404s leaves a tab dead on first use; and a worker
URL that 404s fails silently (a Worker constructor does not throw for a
missing file). This reads each of them and checks the file exists.
