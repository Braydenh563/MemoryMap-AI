"""Category management: list, create, rename, merge, split, move and delete.

Categories are created implicitly by the AI as it files notes, so over time
they drift: near-duplicates, typos, ones that stopped being useful. These
endpoints are how the user tidies that up.

None of them ever loses a note: renaming onto an existing category merges the
two, and deleting one moves its notes to Uncategorised or to a category named
for them.

**Everything the agent can do, a person can** (INBOX 431 (e), the owner: "the
user needs to be able to easily do anything the ai can do"). Create and merge
call the agent's own tool functions (`ai/tools/categories.py`), so the two
paths cannot come to disagree about what a merge is; moving chosen notes, a
split and a proposed split are what managing by hand needs besides. Every
answer that moves notes names them (`moved_ids`, or `previous` with each
note's old category), which is what the Manage categories panel's undo uses.
