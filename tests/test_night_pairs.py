"""The night shift's passes 4 and 5 (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN I1, H1; row 5).

Pass 4: each claim found this run against the nearest claims of other notes;
a pair the model calls incompatible (or, with no model, two near-identical
claims that differ in a number or a "not") is a `tension`. Pass 5: each open
question against the nearest claims written later in other notes; one the
model says answers it (or, with no model, that holds most of what it asks) is
`answered`. Both are stored on the later side with the other in `payload`,
both are deduplicated by pair (tombstones included), and a run with nothing
new spends nothing on them.
