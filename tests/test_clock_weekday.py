"""The model is told what day it is, and does not have to work it out.

The owner's transcript, 2026-09-21. He had a note saying an assignment was
due "Friday", asked for a reminder two hours before midnight, and got one for
the wrong night. The model's own reasoning shows both faults:

    "The current date and time is 2026-09-21T15:55:00+10:00 (AEST).
     Midnight for today, September 21st, is 2026-09-22T00:00.
     2 hours before midnight is 2026-09-22T22:00."

Two hours before that midnight is the 21st at 22:00, not the 22nd. And
"Friday" was never resolvable at all: an ISO timestamp does not say what
weekday it is, so a small model has to derive one, which is the arithmetic
these models are worst at.

Both are the prompt's fault rather than the model's, because both facts were
cheap to state and were not stated. These tests hold them stated.
