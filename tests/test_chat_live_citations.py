"""The Chat tab numbers a grounded answer's records while it streams (INBOX 320).

The Ask sub-tab already did this with `grounding_live`; the Chat tab's own
stream ignored the event, so its numbers arrived with the finished answer.
The behaviour is measured by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/chatlivecite.js`; this
test holds the wiring the sweep cannot keep honest on its own: the stream
handler exists, the live paint re-places the markers (a paint rebuilds the
step), and the late-bound hook reaches the timeline.
