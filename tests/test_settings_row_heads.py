"""Every Settings row's name is one element in one type (INBOX 854: "filing
style text style is different to the other mini headers?? I think??").

`Categories` and `Tags` were `<span>` in `.setting-label` (600 weight at
`--text-lg`, `.setting-label > span`); `Filing style` was a `<label>`, which
that rule does not reach, so it drew in the body face. Of 49 row heads in the
page, 48 were spans and that one was the exception. A row whose control needs a
name takes `aria-labelledby` to its span instead.
