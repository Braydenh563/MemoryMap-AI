"""What points at a note, from anywhere in the notebook.

INBOX 246, the owner's second sentence: "I want it to show in notes if they
are attached to or referenced in/by a document, note, whiteboard, or
mindmap." `GET /entries/{id}/references` is that answer.

The two halves are found two different ways and the tests are split the same
way, because the failure modes are different. A board or a map carries a note
as a real row, so that half is exact and its only interesting cases are the
ones about which *kind* of board it is and what happens to a note with no
name. A document or another note carries it as text, so that half can be
wrong in both directions: it can miss a reference that is there, and it can
claim one that is not.
