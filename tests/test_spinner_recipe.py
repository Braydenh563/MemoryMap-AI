"""One recipe for "the app is working on it" (INBOX 441 (2)).

The owner, over a screenshot of a note reading "Atlas is reading..." beside a
small blue ring: "make sure all these loading spinners are consistent across
the app". Measured before this recipe (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/spinners.js`),
the same state was drawn six different ways:

- the `.spinner` ring, 2px stroke, 0.7s;
- the Phosphor `circle-notch` glyph, 1.1s, under two keyframe names
  (`chip-spin`, `chip-filing-spin`), in three colours depending on the host;
- a status line that was only a pulsing word, whose animation
  (`pulse-fade`) had **no `@keyframes` at all**, so it never moved;
- the chat reply dots standing in for a loading line in a toast and in the
  Library (`typingDots` is the *reply* indicator, a different thing);
- a busy button that was `disabled` plus `aria-busy` and showed nothing;
- a dozen "Working..." lines that carried a decorative, motionless icon.

The recipe is DESIGN.md's row "Something is working on it": **`.spinner`**
(one element, drawn by `spinnerEl()` or the `ph:spin` marker in `setLabel`),
sized in `em` of the text beside it, one stroke, one colour, one speed, a slow
opacity pulse under reduced motion; **`setBusy(button, busy, label)`** for a
button. These tests are the ratchet: a second spin keyframe, a re-introduced
glyph spinner, an ASCII "..." in the copy, or a hand-built `.spinner` all fail
here, not in a screenshot.

Like the other frontend lints this cannot see the DOM; what runs in a browser
is `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/spinners.js`, which measures every indicator it can
trigger and prints the distinct signatures (one, plus the filled-button
colour).
