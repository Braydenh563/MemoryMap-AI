// **Is the mind map slow?** (INBOX 305, the owner: "the mindmap is slow.")
//
// This is the one claim in that report that had to be measured before
// anything was designed, because if it is true it outranks the other five:
// no amount of control-layout work rescues a surface that stutters. So this
// probe takes five numbers at three map sizes and asserts nothing about
// taste.
//
// **The five numbers, and why each one.**
//
//  1. `open` — from the call that opens the board to the frame on which all
//     N nodes are in the DOM *and* the browser has painted twice. Two rAFs,
//     not one: the first fires after the render pass has written the layer,
//     the second only once that write has actually been composited, so a
//     single rAF would report the time to queue the paint rather than the
//     time to see it.
//  2. `pan` — the frame deltas during a real hand-tool drag across the
//     canvas, driven with `page.mouse` rather than dispatched events, so the
//     hit-testing, the pointer capture and the transform write are all on
//     the measured path.
//  3. `drag` — the same, on one node, which is the other gesture a person
//     makes constantly and which re-renders rather than re-transforms.
//  4. `zoom` — the frame deltas during a real ctrl-wheel zoom in and back
//     out again, driven with `page.mouse.wheel`. The third thing the owner
//     named, and the one that had never been measured: see the block that
//     takes it for why it is the one of the three that cannot be composited.
//  5. `layout` — `wbMapTidyPositions`, the pure position computation, timed
//     on its own with no network and no render, plus `wbMapIndex` (which
//     every map action calls first) and `renderWhiteboard` (which every map
//     action calls last). Splitting the three is the whole point: a tidy
//     that feels slow is one of them, and the fix is different for each.
//
// **The map is built through the real route.** `/whiteboard/boards/import`
// with a Markdown outline is a route a person actually has (the Board menu's
// own import), it produces ordinary `topic` objects with real `parent_id`
// edges, and it is the only way to get to 500 nodes without measuring 500
// round trips of `wbMapAddChild` instead of the thing being asked about.
//
// Frame deltas are collected in the page by a rAF loop installed before the
// gesture and stopped after it, so what is reported is what the compositor
// actually did, not what a timer around the gesture would suggest.
//
// **It is not a fast sweep**, and it cannot be: building and opening a
// 500-node map is the thing being measured. Budget about three minutes for
// the default three sizes. `SIZES=50` cuts it to one size when what is
// wanted is a regression check rather than the shape of the curve.
