"""The documents editor's command table (DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 4 item 4).

One table feeds two surfaces: the command palette's "This document" group and
the `?` sheet's editor section. The suite cannot see the DOM, so what it can
check is the thing that actually breaks: a row pointing at a control that is
not in `index.html` any more looks perfectly correct in the table and does
nothing at all when pressed, which is the "a feature that never ran once"
shape CLAUDE.md's review list puts second.
