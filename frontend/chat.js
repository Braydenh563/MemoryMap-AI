//: The pattern this replaces was `if (!node.isConnected) return

//: that outlives its element grows with every turn of a long conversation) and

//: indicator on purpose: `reattachStreamingTurn` appends every node of the

//: `clearPending` moves the pending line to the end of the steps.
//:
//: One tick landing inside one of those windows killed the timer for good.
//: The node came back, the animation did not, and it froze mid-cycle showing
//: its three dots standing still, reported as "the text streaming animation
//: stops moving and just shows as 3 lines", and again as "I scrolled up while
//: still streaming the response and the generating and animation disappeared",
//: which is the same timer dying during the re-render that scrolling caused.
//:
//: So: skip the work while detached, and only give up once the node has stayed
//: gone for `GRACE_TICKS` in a row. A re-parent is one frame; ten ticks is
//: several seconds, which is far longer than any re-render and still bounded,

//: Asked for directly: *"make the 3-dot animation change to something cool and

//: for a response it goes back to the 3-dot button, and make the transition
//: between animations smooth as well."*
//:
//: `thinking` keeps the dots: they are the universal "waiting" idiom and
//: everyone already reads them. `writing` swaps to this app's own motif: a
//: short run of nodes with a line drawing itself between them, which is a
//: notebook writing a new thought into its graph. Every other indicator in
//: here (`Loading…`, `Generating caption…`) simply never leaves `thinking`,
//: so nothing else changes shape.
//:
//: Both live in the same box at the same time and cross-fade, so the swap
//: cannot cause a layout jump mid-stream, the container is sized once and
//: the two children are stacked in it.
//:
//: The SVG is appended *after* the three dot spans on purpose:
//: `.typing-dots span:nth-child(2)`/`(3)` address those dots by position, and
//: putting anything before them would silently re-time the bounce.
//: **A mouse wheel must scroll a horizontal strip.** Reported: "if the tabs
//: bar becomes scrollable, I cant do it with mouse, only with touch or my
//: trackpad."
//:
//: That is the browser's behaviour, not a bug in the strip: a wheel emits
//: `deltaY`, and an element that only overflows on X ignores it, so a
//: trackpad (which emits real `deltaX` on a two-finger swipe) and a
//: touchscreen work while a wheel does nothing at all. Every app with a tab
//: strip translates the axis by hand; this is that, once, for all of them.
//:
//: Three conditions before it takes over, so it never steals a gesture that
//: meant something else: the element must actually overflow horizontally, the
//: gesture must be vertical-only (`deltaX === 0`, a trackpad's own horizontal
//: swipe is left alone), and the scroll must have somewhere to go in that
//: direction, so at either end the page scrolls normally instead of the strip
//: swallowing the wheel.

// **A working signal that says what it is working on.**
//
// Reported repeatedly, and finally with two screenshots: "there is no cycling
// or rotating thinking or generating animations", over a bubble reading a
// motionless italic "Thinking…". Two separate things produce that:
//
//  - **Reduced motion.** `typingDots` above swaps every animation for one
//    static word when the OS asks for less motion, and the desktop shell
//    inherits Windows' own "show animations" setting, which is off on a lot
//    of machines. The honest fix is not to animate anyway; it is to stop the
//    non-animated state being *dead*. Changing text is information, not
//    motion, so it is allowed where a bounce is not.
//  - **One label for the whole turn.** Even animating, three dots that mean
//    the same thing from the first millisecond to the last say nothing about
//    a turn that took eleven seconds and did four different things.
//
// So this pairs the indicator with a label that the stream updates as real
// events arrive: what it is doing now, in the app's own words. Nothing here
// invents a stage: every string it is given comes from an event that
// actually happened (see `sendChatMessage`), because a progress line that
// guesses is worse than one that repeats itself.
//: **Short lines shown while you wait, and every one of them is true.**
//:
//: Asked for: *"add some generated short sentence musings while the thinking
//: dots are showing."* The obvious reading is flavour text, and the obvious
//: implementation is a model writing whimsy about what it is doing. This
//: file's own rule forbids that, and the rule is right: `progressLine` must
//: never invent a stage, because a progress line that guesses is worse than
//: one that repeats itself. A cheerful invented sentence next to a real
//: status label is precisely a guess wearing a status label's clothes.
//:
//: So these are the honest version of the same idea, and they are better than
//: whimsy would have been: facts about *this app* that a person waiting for a
//: local model has time to read and reason to want. A wait is the one moment
//: the interface has someone's attention with nothing to do, spending it on
//: the thing the app most needs to teach (what it is doing with your notes,
//: and where they are going, which is nowhere) is worth more than a joke.

//: a claim about privacy, and privacy claims are the one kind this app must
