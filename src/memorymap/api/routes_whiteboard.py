"""Whiteboard: note cards and freehand sketches placed on a canvas.

A "board" is itself a note (`board_id` points at an entry), so a board is
something you can search, tag and file like anything else in the notebook, 
and `board_id = NULL` is the one unnamed scratch board every notebook starts
with.

Two rules run through all of it, both learned by their absence in the first
version:

- **A node has to point at a note that exists.** Nothing validated `entry_id`,
  so a card could be created for note 9999 and the board would then fail to
  render for good, with no way to remove the card from the UI.
- **A write has to be scoped to the board it claims.** `PUT`/`DELETE` took an
  id and nothing else, so any node on any board could be moved or deleted by
  guessing a number: and `PUT` silently ignored `board_id`, so "move this
  card to that board" quietly did nothing at all.

#: (MINDMAP_PLAN.md §4, option B), the same rows, the same endpoints, one

#: is the only thing an ordinary whiteboard has ever done; the others are the
#: standard mindmap arrangements (MINDMAP_PLAN.md §3.1). Stored rather than
#: computed because it is a property of the map, not of the session looking
#: at it, the layout you chose has to be there tomorrow.
#:
#: "tree-left" and "tree-both" were added for MINDMAP_PLAN §13e: §12.0's own
#: decision list promised both and §13.4 measured them missing, and
#: both-sides is the layout Coggle is known for. A value this set does not
#: know is refused rather than stored, so an older client asking for one of
#: these is the only compatibility question, and it gets the default.
#: "logic-right", "timeline", "fishbone" and "tree-table" for MINDMAP_PLAN 15

#: **A map made from text starts laid out** (audit FEAT-05, 2026-10-05). The
#: import and the accepted AI proposal used the board default, Free, while a
#: map made by hand (`createNewBoard`) and the AI's `create_mindmap` start in
#: tree-right: so the first Tab on an imported map piled new topics onto old
#: ones, 240 overlapping pairs over 101 topics. One default for every map
#: door.
DEFAULT_MAP_LAYOUT = "tree-right"

#: **The map's own theme** (MINDMAP_PLAN.md §13e, the owner: "the
#: customisation features are lacking severely"). §13.4 measured the gap
#: precisely: a topic has eleven fields and the map as a whole has none, so
#: every one of the eleven is set one topic at a time and the only bulk
#: operation of any kind is "Reset to branch" on a single node.
#:
#: **What is in here and what is not is one question asked eleven times**:
#: does this field describe *this topic*, or how *this map* draws topics? The
#: ten below are the second kind. Left out, deliberately: `icon`, `core`,
#: `image`, `link` and `edge_label`, each of which names which topic this is
#: rather than how it is drawn (a map whose every topic is a core idea with
#: the same picture is not a theme); `edge_bend` and `edge_slide`, which are
#: a position on one line; and `color`, which is not one value but a rule: it
#: seeds a whole subtree, and the map-level answer to it is a branch palette,
#: which is drawn in two places (the canvas from d3, the Library thumbnail
#: from `MAP_BRANCH_PALETTE` on this side) and would have to teach the
#: preview cache about itself before it could be picked. That is its own row
#: in §13e, not a corner of this one.
#:
#: The value `None` means "this map says nothing, use the app's default",
#: which is what every map has today: a theme that stores nothing draws
#: exactly the map that was drawn before this existed.
#:
#: **`palette` and `font` joined later, and they are the map's, not a
#: topic's** (§13e's remainder, decision 8). A branch palette is the answer
#: to `color` at map level: not one value but the list a first-level branch
#: claims its colour from, so it is a name here (`MAP_BRANCH_PALETTES`) and
#: the one list both drawings read. A font is the face every topic and line
#: label on the map is set in; no topic has a face of its own, so it never
#: resolves onto a topic (`MAP_LEVEL_THEME_FIELDS`).

# --- the event log for a board (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN B1, Brief 7) ---------------
#
# The entry managers record one event per write with whole-field values, which
# is what lets a note replay to its current state and a version be put back.
# A board recorded nothing at all, so the half of B1's own wording that says
# "and `routes_whiteboard.py`'s manager" was not true: a card could be moved,
# a text box rewritten and a branch deleted with no record of who did it or
# what it said before.
#
# **What a board's replayable entity is.** A note is one row and replays to
# one dict. A board is not: it is a note plus every card, sketch and object
# on it. So the entity here is the *item*, one of `whiteboard_node`,
# `whiteboard_sketch` and `whiteboard_object`, each replaying to its own
# current state through the same `events.replay`; the board's own events
# (`board` created, duplicated, its type or layout changed) are on the board.
# A board's whole state is the union of its items' replays, which is the only
# reading that keeps `replay` one function rather than one per surface.
#
# Every write below is wrapped in `@events.writes`, not left to remember a
# call: the decorator is what makes "one write, one event" true by
# construction, so a route that grows a second write inside it folds rather
# than quietly recording twice. The exception is any route that calls an
# entry manager (`rename_board` through `update_entry`): opening a scope
# there would fold the *note's* own edit into the board's event and take it
# out of that note's history, which is a worse loss than the tidier shape is
# worth. Those record beside the manager's event instead, and only for the
# fields the manager does not know about.


# The payload builders themselves live in `core/events.py`, beside
# `entry_state`, because the routes are no longer the only writer of these
# events: the AI's own board tools (`ai/tools/whiteboard.py`) record the same
# ones, `ai/` cannot import `api/` at module level, and two copies of a state
# function is how two writers of one entity come to disagree about what its
# state is. Aliased rather than called through `events.` at every site so the
# twenty-odd uses below read as they did.

    Reported directly: "the different board options confuse me." The cause
    wasn't a bug so much as a design choice nobody had reckoned with yet, a
    board being *just a note* (this file's own opening comment) is right for
    the data model, but the picker took that literally and listed every
    single note as a "board", the vast majority of which had never been used
    as one. A notebook with 50 notes had a 50-item "Switch board" dropdown
    with no way to tell which one, if any, was actually a board someone had
    drawn on. This lists only notes with at least one card or sketch on them,
    plus the always-present default board.

    `?type=map` (or `board`) narrows it to one kind, the Library's Maps
    chip. Filtered in Python rather than in SQL because a board's type lives
    inside a JSON settings blob (`Entry.board_settings`), and because this
    function already materialises every board to build its preview: the list
    is tens of rows long, not thousands. An unknown value returns nothing
    rather than everything: a filter that silently ignores itself reads as
    "you have no maps" only after the user has read every row.

    **Paged.** `limit`, `offset` and an `X-Total-Count` counted over the same
    type filter as the page, so a caller that wants every board asks for the
    next page until it has them all (`apiPagedList` in the frontend). The
    default board is row one of page one and is counted like any other. The
    order is the default board, then entry id ascending, which is the order
    this list already came back in; the tiebreaker matters more here than
    elsewhere, because two boards created in the same second would otherwise
    be free to swap places between two pages and hide one of themselves.

    The page boundary is also where the cost is: `_preview_fields` is a query
    per board, and it now runs for the rows in the page rather than for every
    board in the notebook.

    own markdown, which has none, see ROADMAP item 20a for that still-open
    gap), so this is a flat query, not new plumbing.

    **Superseded in the Library by `/media`**, which lists every uploaded
    file rather than only the ones that happen to be on a board, so nothing
    in `frontend/js/*.js` names this any more (INBOX 261, found by
    `scratchpad/probe_dead_routes.py`). Kept as the board-scoped view, which
    `/media` does not offer; this paragraph is here so the next scan does not
    re-open the question.

    **Paged**, with `X-Total-Count` over the same selection as the page and
    the row id as the order, which is also the tiebreaker two rows created in
    the same second need to stop them swapping places between pages.

    The one thing worth knowing about the shape below: the "does this row
    actually carry a url" test cannot be a SQL filter, because the url is a
    key inside a JSON blob. So the ids and blobs are read first and filtered
    in Python, and the page is taken from *that* list. Counting every image
    row instead and skipping the empty ones per page would make
    `X-Total-Count` bigger than the number of rows a caller can ever collect,
    and `apiPagedList` walks until it has that many: it would never stop.

    stack overflow rather than a refusal. These two had the same exposure from
    two directions. Nothing caps how deep a map built by hand can go
    (`MAX_IMPORT_DEPTH` caps an import; the Tab key is not an import), so a

    back to it, and a recursive walk of that never returns at all.

    `build(parent_element, node)` returns the element it made, so the walk
    holds no state of its own between calls: two exports running at once share
    nothing, which a module-level map of node id to element would not have

    Nesting is clamped at `MAX_MAP_DEPTH` rather than cut: a node past the cap

#: - `edge_label`: FreeMind has no label on an edge at all. Freeplane grew
#:   one much later, in its own namespace, which FreeMind then refuses.
#: - `edge_dashed`: `<edge>` has STYLE, COLOR and WIDTH, and no dash.
#: - `align`: FreeMind aligns a node by which side of the root it sits on,
#:   not by a text alignment, so there is nothing to write it into.
#: - `edge_bend`/`edge_slide`: `<edge>` has no waypoint of any kind. Freeplane
#:   grew one much later as a `<edge>` child in its own namespace, spelled in
#:   absolute coordinates, which is the one spelling these two deliberately are
#:   not (see the fields' own comment): writing it would claim a shape in units
#:   the file cannot honour and would not come back as itself.
#: - `image`: FreeMind's own way to put a picture in a node is a
#:   `<richcontent>` body of HTML with an `<img>` in it, and the src this app
#:   has to write is `/media/...`, which resolves to a picture only on the
#:   install that holds the file. So the honest export is the url as a private
