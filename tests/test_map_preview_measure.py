"""A board preview's labels are measured on a canvas, never by layout.

INBOX 496 ("it takes a while to load the boards and maps library subtab"),
profiled on a first visit to 34 boards: 172ms inside `mapPreviewTextWidth` and
most of 475ms of layout, because each new label (and, through
`mapPreviewFitText`, every shorter cut of a long one) was a fresh
`getComputedTextLength`, each forcing a layout of a page that the gallery was
still building. The font is read once; `measureText` lays nothing out.
