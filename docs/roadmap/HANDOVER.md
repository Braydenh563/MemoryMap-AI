# Session handover

> **The other four:** [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) (live work) · [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) (§1–§29) · [ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md) (§30–§34, including the AGPL/MIT constraint) · [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) (already built).

## Same session, continued: the roadmap was re-audited and re-prioritised

The user pushed back, correctly: three sessions in a row (§35 → §36 → §37) had
kept extending the newest polish batch instead of touching the other 34
sections underneath it. Asked for the roadmap to be honestly re-prioritised
and then worked through **without stopping to ask** — treat that as standing
authorisation for this and future sessions to keep pulling from
[ROADMAP.md §38](../ROADMAP.md#38-where-this-actually-stands--the-backlog-audit)
until told otherwise.

**What happened:** a full audit of BACKLOG.md (§1–§29) and ANALYSIS.md
(§30–§34) against the actual code, not the backlog's own prose. Found real
staleness in both directions — §4 (Library tab), §11 (hybrid retrieval), §16
(status bar, listed twice) in BACKLOG.md, and §33/§34 in ANALYSIS.md were all
marked open for things that are built, including the project's own outside
review's #1 recommendation ("finish the agentic loop") being satisfied by
`run_skill`/`make_plan` without ever being marked so. Each is corrected in
place, not just noted in ROADMAP.md. §38 is the new live front door and
supersedes §37's own priority list; **read §38 first**, before anything else
in this file including the section below.

**§38's first item is done too, same session:** the notebook was actually
scale-tested (`scripts/scale_test.py`, a generated fixture up to 50,000
notes), not just flagged as untested. Found two real N+1 query patterns —
`GET /graph` resolving each note's category with its own `session.get()`
call, `search_manager.semantic_search` materialising a full `Entry` ORM
object for every embedded note just to score most of them away — profiled,
not guessed at (10,000 category lookups were 87% of one `GET /graph` call's
time on a 10k-note notebook). Both fixed the same way: score or match against
raw ids first, fetch the real `Entry` rows only for what survives. Real
numbers at 50k notes: `GET /graph` 19s→1.8s, chat's search 6.6s→0.5s, the
`related_notes` agent tool's neighbour-suggestion call ~20s→1.3s. Pinned by
`tests/test_scale_query_counts.py` (a query *count*, not a timing — timing
assertions are flaky under CI load). Full writeup, including what's still
open (`GET /graph?similarity=true` is a real O(n²) — 30 seconds at just 2,000
notes — and is off by default rather than fixed), is in ANALYSIS.md §34,
item 2.

**§38's second item is done too:** a headless Playwright smoke suite,
`tests-e2e/` (own `package.json`, doesn't touch the no-build-step frontend),
wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a new `e2e` job. Verified locally
against a real running app before being trusted, not just authored — and it
paid off immediately: it caught that "documents" is in `app.js`'s own `TABS`
array but has had no `#tab-btn-documents` in the nav bar since §36F replaced
it with Library, which a test written from the array alone (what a first
draft did) would have silently gotten wrong. Covers every tab actually
reachable from the bar for console errors, uncaught exceptions and
horizontal overflow, plus one real interaction (capture a note, see it in
Browse). **Next: ROADMAP.md §38's item 3, graph layouts beyond tree/radial —
now with a smoke suite to build against.**

**The corrected order, top of it:** scale-test the notebook past a few
hundred notes (cheap, flagged by the outside review, never done), a headless
Playwright smoke suite in CI (the actual fix for "every layout bug passed a
green run"), graph layouts beyond tree/radial, the Timeline branch/line view,
Chat/Agent/Browse sub-tabs, meeting-notes/transcription, onboarding
diagnostics, then the `app.js` module split riding in on the sub-tabs work.
Full reasoning for each is in §38.

---

## Previous entry in this session: §37's top five, done

Worked §37's own priority list in order, straight through 37B–37E. **37B
decided (no lock-screen Quit button — the LAN-DoS trade-off wasn't worth a
convenience button, decided with the user directly). 37D.1, 37J, 37F and 37E
are built and verified in Chromium** — details and reasoning are in
ROADMAP.md's §37B/§37D/§37F/§37J/§37E, updated in place rather than duplicated
here. **Next up per §37's own ranking: 37C, the chat dock density pass** —
37C's own note says to re-look at it only after 37E ships, which it now has.

**37F had a real surprise worth internalising**: most of "the graph toolbar is
bulky" was already fixed the *day before* that section was written
(`3e77f57`) — the roadmap text describing twelve controls in one row was
stale the moment it was committed. Checking the running app first (not just
grep, an actual look) is what caught it; building against the roadmap
paragraph instead would have redone finished work. The one genuine gap —
Trace as a permanent row — was real and is now fixed.

**37E (zoom) turned out to need less new design than its own write-up
expected**, because a check answered the "which CSS mechanism" question before
any prototype branch was needed: `data-fontsize="small"/"large"` already
scales the root font in production, and control heights/icons are already in
rem, so a root-`font-size` percentage was already proven to reach everything.
The one real design question — zoom fighting Text size over the same
`font-size` property, not zoom fighting density as §37E's write-up predicted —
was solved with one multiplying custom property (`--zoom`, composed via
`calc()`), not a rethink of either control.

**What I could not check:** anything about a real model (unchanged, standing
caveat), and the desktop shell. Everything UI in this session's five items
*was* driven in Chromium — screenshots, a resize drag measured before and
after, root `font-size` measured in the DOM at three zoom levels, full page
reloads to confirm `graph-trace-open`/web-panel-width/zoom persistence
(including via the server-mirrored `ui_state` path, not just `localStorage`),
and a full `pytest tests/` (~1,600 tests) plus `ruff check .` green after each
batch.

---

Written at the end of the session that **deleted three surfaces**, moved web
search out of the chat dock, added embedding-model management, and — in a long
follow-on round the same session — fixed six more reported bugs and triaged a
much bigger list into [ROADMAP.md §37](../ROADMAP.md#37-reported-in-one-session--the-second-big-batch-reprioritised).
Everything here is either a fact you can check or a thing I could not check and
am saying so about.

**Start at [Where to start next](#where-to-start-next--ranked-with-the-reason).**
That section now leads with §37 — read it first, the ranked list below it is
what came before.

---

## Read this before you touch anything

**Every UI fix this session was measured in Chromium first, and the
measurement was the fix each time.** Not a slogan — the record:

| Reported as | What the browser said |
| --- | --- |
| "the ui issue with the bottom dock" | Dock box ending at y=614, composer at y=814. 200px outside the card, Send below the window. |
| "the web search panel dock is squashed ugly" | A search box, a results list and a whole web page inside `min(38vh, 20rem)`. |
| "the graph is out of the main ui panel again" | `min-height: 22rem` under the map + a two-row legend > a 700px window. |
| "the notes sidebar too" (a second sidebar, same day) | Both were 22px too tall. One `calc`, written by hand in three rules, each missing the page's bottom padding. |
| "the embedding model doesn't redownload every time, right?" | Right — those are HuggingFace *metadata* requests, not the weights. |
| "quick sketch's Close button just darkens the background" | Confirm dialog at z-index 55, sketch overlay at z-index 60 — the dialog painted behind it. `elementFromPoint` on the confirm card returned the sketch card underneath it. |
| "before signing in, a popup says failed to load entries" | A stale token in `localStorage` fires a dozen bootstrap requests before unlock; each 401 correctly showed the lock screen *and* was separately toasted. |

A bug reported twice on two different
surfaces is usually one bug in a shared expression (the sidebar heights, both
missing the same padding term), and a bug that darkens a whole screen with no
visible dialog is usually two elements at the same z-index tier fighting over
which paints on top, not something actually broken inside the dialog itself.
`--page-sticky-h` names the first kind now; look for the second kind — a
private `z-index` outside the shared 55/60 tiers — before assuming a reported
"nothing happens" click is a logic bug.

The app runs on localhost and the sandbox has Chromium. **Reproduce first.**

---

## The traps that will cost you an hour each

1. **Any `100vh`/`vh` sum is already wrong.** Unchanged from the last
   handover and it bit twice more this session — `46vh` for the logs list and
   `min(38vh, 20rem)` for the web panel, both of which were guesses at how
   much of the window some *other* furniture was using. **Anything sized
   against the window goes through `--page-viewport` or `--page-sticky-h`.**
   Better still, size it against the box it is actually in: the chat sidebar
   needs no arithmetic at all now, because its grid area is already exactly
   the right height.

2. **A flex parent that can shrink, with children that cannot, does not clip
   — it overflows.** `.chat-dock` was `flex: 0 1 auto` with every child at
   `flex: 0 0 auto`. The box shrank; the contents did not; they drew straight
   through the bottom of the card, and the card's rounded corner cutting
   across the middle of a control is what that looks like. **If a container
   is allowed to shrink, something inside it has to be allowed to shrink too,
   or it must not be allowed to shrink at all.**

3. **A stacking context you cannot see.** `backdrop-filter` creates one. So
   does `position: absolute` with any `z-index`. Fix by lifting the *owning*
   element (`.menu-open`), never the menu. Still true, still the first thing
   to check when a menu is reported behind something.

4. **A lint that slices a fixed number of characters will fail on a
   comment.** `test_frontend_ids.py` did, and a lint that fails on prose is a
   lint people learn to weaken. It slices to the end of the function now.

5. **Two overlays at a private `z-index: 60` will eat a nested confirm
   dialog.** `#sketch-overlay` and `#improve-overlay` both sat above
   `.modal-overlay`'s shared `z-index: 55` — the same tier toasts and popups
   use, for a reason that had nothing to do with either overlay. Any modal
   that might one day open a `confirmDialog()`/`promptDialog()` on top of
   itself has to be at 55, not 60, or the confirm paints underneath it and
   looks like a click that did nothing. **Grep for `z-index: 60` before
   building a new full-screen overlay** — it is currently only toasts, the
   command palette, the notification panel and the AI-status popup, and none
   of those ever open a nested dialog on top of themselves; a new overlay
   that copies the number without copying that property is this bug again.

6. **A per-step `.catch()` in a bootstrap loop will re-report a session-wide
   condition as N separate failures.** `startApp()`'s `step()` helper toasts
   whatever error each parallel request throws, which is right for a request
   that actually failed on its own and wrong for "the token expired," which
   `api()` already announces once by showing the lock screen. **Any error
   that is really "this whole session is in state X," not "this one call
   failed," needs a marker property** (`error.isLockout` is the one example
   now) so a generic retry/report loop can tell the two apart — the loop
   cannot know from the error's `.message` alone.

---

## What is now true that wasn't

### The three panels are gone (§36G) — the first surface this project removed

`#bin-panel`, `#activity-panel`, `#tags-panel`, `renderBin`, `renderActivity`,
`renderTags`, `PANELS`, `showPanel`, the `.panel-close` wiring, the
`#bin-empty` handler and `entryItem`'s `options.bin` branch.

The prerequisite was **reading a binned note in full** (`#binned-overlay`,
`GET /entries/{id}?deleted=true`), which was the one thing the panel could do
that a Library card could not. §36G now records the rule that came out of it:
*a surface may be replaced without being deleted, but only for as long as it
can still do something its replacement cannot — so write that thing down when
the replacement ships, because it is the whole of the remaining work.*

### Web search is a column, not a drawer in the dock

The dock is a control strip and its job is to stay short. A reading surface
inside it had to be capped, and the cap made it unusable — the two symptoms
(pushing the composer off the bottom, then being too small to read) were the
same mistake from either side. As a column beside the conversation it needs no
cap at all, and you can read a source and type about it at once.

**`fitComposerToDock` is the other half.** A hand-dragged composer height is a
preference and is kept as one: only the *applied* height is trimmed to the
room the card has, never `localStorage`, so the box comes back to what you
dragged it to the moment the window is big enough. It iterates, because one
subtraction does not converge — the message list grows into the height the
composer gives back.

### Optional extras and embedding models are one screen

Both are "things downloaded to this machine, with a way to undo it".
`core/extras.py` and `core/embedmodels.py` share a security property that must
survive any change: **the request names an allowlist entry, never a package or
a repo id.** It matters more for models, because removal deletes a directory.
HuggingFace's `org/name` → `models--org--name` flattening is itself the
traversal defence — it looks like formatting, so there is a test saying so.

`unavailable` on an extra greys the button out **and** refuses the request
server-side. The greyed button is a courtesy; the refusal is the rule.

### A 🧭 Plan button, and skills that take you to themselves

`make_plan` has existed since §35K with no way to ask for it. The button sends
what you typed with a sentence asking for a plan — a sentence rather than a
request flag, because the planning path is the model's own tool and a second
route into it could drift from the first.

`startSkill` now switches to the chat tab. It did not, so a skill started from
the dashboard streamed into a tab nobody was looking at.

### A second round: six more reported bugs fixed, a much longer list triaged

The same session, after the handover above was mostly written, took a long
follow-on list of reports. Six were small and clear enough to fix on the spot
(§37A: the sketch close bug, the app-wide select-arrow fix, the notes-list
toolbar heights, the category-actions/count clash, the pre-auth toast noise,
the dashboard-first-load default) and are described with their reasoning in
[ROADMAP.md §37](../ROADMAP.md#37-reported-in-one-session--the-second-big-batch-reprioritised).
The rest — a chat-dock density pass, a resizable/refined web panel, a UI zoom
setting, the graph toolbar, sketch image/document upload, llama.cpp, chat
compression as an agent tool, a real Timeline fix, emoji rendering, and the
"full UI audit" umbrella — is triaged there too, in priority order.

**One deliberate non-decision:** a Quit button on the lock screen was asked
for and is not built. It needs `/shutdown` reachable without the unlock
token, which is a real trade-off (§37B) — building it silently inside a batch
of forty other fixes would have hidden a decision about the auth model that
deserves to be made in the open.

**The roadmap's own top-level "here's what to do" sections had also drifted**,
and this was the session that found it: "Priority map" listed the Library tab
as an open Tier 3 item after it had been built *and* had panels deleted from
it. All three legacy priority sections (`Next session: start here`, `Do these
next`, `Priority map`) now carry a correction note pointing at what's actually
still open, and the fully-closed security-audit tier moved to HISTORY.md so
ROADMAP.md stayed under its own 2,000-line lint.

---

## What I could not check, and you should not assume

1. **Anything involving a real model.** Unchanged, and still the standing
   caveat. The 🧭 Plan button's instruction text has never been tried against
   a running Ollama — the *machinery* is the proven §35K path, but whether a
   7B model reliably reaches for `make_plan` when asked in those words is
   untested. It is one string, `PLAN_PREFIX` in `app.js`.
2. **The embedding-model download itself.** `huggingface_hub` is not
   installed in the sandbox (it arrives with `sentence-transformers`, which
   must not be installed here), so `can_download()` is false and every test
   covers the refusal path, the allowlist and the size calculation. **The
   happy path — `snapshot_download` actually fetching a model — has never
   run.** It is four lines; look there first if a download misbehaves.
3. **SearXNG autostart.** No Docker in the sandbox. The preference, the
   plumbing and the startup hook are wired and the thread is started; the
   container coming up is unverified.
4. **The desktop shell and Windows.** Unchanged.
5. **The graph's new world box.** The clamp that keeps nodes in frame used to
   clamp to the *viewport*, which is wide and short — so repulsion pushed
   outwards, the walls pushed back, and seventeen notes settled into a
   lattice. Reported as *"the graph nodes are like locked into a box"*, which
   is exactly what it was. The world is `1.8 ×` the frame now, so the forces
   decide the shape and the clamp only bounds the endless drift it was written
   for. **The reasoning is solid and I could not observe it** — the sandbox
   reclaimed the server three times at the end of the session. `ruff`, the
   full suite and `node --check` pass; the change is one constant and two
   comparisons in the tick handler. Look at it first if the graph is reported
   wrong, and if 1.8 is too loose the fit will simply start further out.
6. **The Library's ⋯ menu positioning.** Reported this session as "off in
   positioning" on the cards view. I could not reproduce it before the session
   ended — `.menu-wrap` is already `position: relative`, so `right: 0` should
   anchor the menu to the ⋯ button, and what the screenshot shows may be the
   menu correctly covering the card *below* rather than being mispositioned.
   **Not fixed, and not investigated to a conclusion.** Measure it with
   `elementFromPoint` before changing anything.
7. **"The notes sidebar keeps changing its height slightly, increasing the
   gap at the bottom."** Checked and *not* reproduced: `#sidebar`'s height
   measured identically 1.5 seconds apart, idle, on the browse section with
   two categories. That is not the same as confirming there is no bug — it
   means whatever triggers it is an interaction I did not try (switching
   sub-tabs and back, a widget re-render after `loadCategories()`'s
   deliberately-unawaited fetch resolves late, a tag-suggestion refresh). The
   sidebar's own height rule (`height: var(--page-sticky-h)`, fixed this
   session) should make this structurally impossible now regardless of cause
   — it no longer sizes to its own content — but say so only after it is
   re-reported, don't assume it's already covered.

---

## Where to start next — ranked, with the reason

**A second, larger batch arrived after most of this handover was written —
start with that.** It is triaged and ordered in
[ROADMAP.md §37](../ROADMAP.md#37-reported-in-one-session--the-second-big-batch-reprioritised),
at the user's explicit request to reprioritise before doing anything else.
Six items in it are already fixed this session (§37A) and verified in
Chromium; the rest is ranked in §37's own "Priority order for the next
session" list at the end of that section. The short version, so you don't have
to follow the link immediately:

1. **§37B — a five-minute decision with the user**, before anything else: does
   the lock screen get a working Quit button, which means an unauthenticated
   `/shutdown`-equivalent route. The trade-off (local-only vs LAN exposure) is
   written out in full there. Two other things are blocked on the answer.
2. **§37D.1** — make the web panel resizable. `makeSidebarResizable()` already
   does this for three sidebars; the web panel isn't in that function's list
   yet, and it doesn't size itself the way the other three do (a `flex` clamp
   rather than a grid column), so it needs the drag-handle treatment adapted
   rather than a one-line addition.
3. **§37J — the Timeline.** Genuinely broken, not merely unpolished: clipped
   two-line chips in ~88px columns, showing raw `**markdown**` syntax via
   `textContent` instead of `renderMarkdown`. **One correction to make before
   starting:** the overlapping-labels screenshot in that same report is the
   *Graph* tab, already fixed this session by widening the simulation's world
   box (below) — don't re-diagnose it as a Timeline bug.
4. **§37F — the graph toolbar.** Four bands of chrome (heading+search,
   layout/colour, trace row, legend) before the map on the one tab whose job
   is the map. Same grouping technique §36B already proved twice.
5. **§37E — a UI zoom setting.** The single highest-leverage item on the list
   (asked for because a 13" laptop needs ~80% browser zoom to see the app
   comfortably) but it needs a real design spike first — `zoom` vs a root
   `font-size` percentage vs `transform: scale`, each with different
   interactions with `--page-viewport`/`--page-sticky-h`. §37E has the
   trade-offs written out; do the spike before committing to an approach.
6. **§37C — the chat dock, again.** Two sessions have fixed real bugs in it
   without the "bulky" report going away, which means what's left is a density
   pass, not a bug — and §37C says to re-look at it *after* §37E ships, since
   some of "bulky" may resolve once zoom exists.
7. **§37I — compress-as-an-agent-tool.** Needs one design decision first (does
   the agent's own compression skip the human review step the feature was
   built around, or hand off mid-run?) — §37I lays out both sides.
8. **§37G / §37H / §37K** each need one clarifying question answered before
   they can be scoped (sketch image-upload vs the markitdown PDF-importer
   already on the books; llama.cpp wiring, which is a full backend session;
   what "change how emoji render" actually means). Ask, then schedule.
9. **§37L** is the umbrella "full UI audit" ask — deliberately not a task to
   start a session with. Break it into dated sub-items as capacity allows, the
   way §36 itself was built up piece by piece.

### Also still open, from before this batch

#### 1. The document editor, now that it is not a tab

It is reached only from the Library. That frees it to stop being a page laid
out around a list that has left: a wider writing column, and the outline and
"notes it draws on" panels earning their place beside the text instead of
sitting folded shut under a switcher. Asked for directly and still only half
done — the sidebar is fixed, the editor itself is untouched.

#### 2. The Library's ⋯ menu, properly measured

See caveat 6 above. It is a live report and it is unresolved. Half an hour
with `elementFromPoint` settles whether there is a bug at all, which is worth
more than a blind fix.

#### 3. §36G's bookshelf theme, the next two pieces

The spine is built. Next: **shelf rows** with a rule under each group when
sorting by kind, and an **empty state drawn as an empty shelf**. The rule to
hold to is in §36G — anything decorative that makes a card harder to scan
loses to the scan.

#### 4. markitdown, and the sketch pad's image upload — now linked (§37G)

`markitdown` wants a "bring in a PDF as notes" button; §37G's sketch-pad ask
("upload documents and images") may be asking for exactly that button, or for
something scoped inside the sketch pad only — worth confirming with the user
which, since the two are different amounts of work. `llama-cpp-python`'s wiring
is now §37H, with its own scope written out (a new provider, a GGUF file
picker — budget a full session).

#### 5. Two things that are decided, so do not re-derive them

- **Absorbing the Notes tab into the Library: no.** Reasoning in §36G. The
  Library *manages*, the Notes tab *works*.
- **The tab bar is the right length.** It wraps below ~1350px, measured.

#### 6. The largest untouched things

**§9's decorative half** (skins, minimap, PNG/SVG export of the current view)
and **§10's `events` table**, so the Timeline's bands can be events and places
rather than only categories and tags. §37J is a nearer-term Timeline pass and
should probably happen first, since it fixes what's broken before adding what's
missing.

## Practical notes for the next session

- **Running the app:** `PYTHONPATH=src MEMORYMAP_DATA_DIR=<scratch> .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn memorymap.api.app:create_app --factory --port 8781`.
  The `PYTHONPATH` is required and is not in CLAUDE.md's recipe. **Restart it
  after any Python change.** Start it with `setsid … < /dev/null &` — a plain
  `&` in this sandbox dies with the shell that launched it, which cost this
  session three restarts.
- **Do not install torch** or `sentence-transformers`. The suite passes
  without both, and `huggingface_hub` is absent for the same reason.
- **Driving it:** a small `drive.js` that launches Chromium, does first-run
  setup and skips the onboarding overlay is the whole harness.
  `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers`, require
  `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright`.
- **`fetch()` inside `page.evaluate` will 401.** The app's `apiJson` adds the
  unlock token; a bare `fetch` does not, and a 401 in a probe looks exactly
  like a feature that does not work. Call `apiJson` from the page instead —
  it is a module-scope function and is reachable as a bare identifier.
- **A dragged composer height is mirrored to the server** (`ui_state`), so it
  survives a fresh browser profile. Clearing `localStorage` alone will not
  reset it, which will confuse a screenshot.
- **Graph traps, still true:** press the `.graph-core` circle, not the
  `.graph-node` group; a module-scope `let` is not a property of `window`.
- **`elementFromPoint` is how you prove a stacking bug.**
- **Lints that are load-bearing:** `test_style_scale.py`,
  `test_frontend_ids.py`, `test_frontend_handlers.py`, `test_docs_layout.py`,
  `test_docs_site.py`, `test_ui_state.py`, `test_chat_dock.py`. If one fails
  it has found something — **except** when it has found a comment, which
  happened this session; fix the lint's brittleness, not the prose.
- **`test_docs_site.py` mirrors CHANGELOG/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY into `docs/`.**
  Editing the root copy fails the build until you `cp` it across.
- **CI runs `ruff check .`** and CodeQL. CodeQL has now found two
  `py/polynomial-redos` in `search/query.py` in consecutive sessions; both
  times the fix was `str.split` and a set. **A character class with `*` or
  `+` next to an anchor is the shape to avoid.**
