"""What the notebook worked out for itself (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I1 and I9).

A derived fact is a sentence the app decided was worth remembering *about* a
note: a claim the note makes, or a question it leaves open. Nothing here is
ever written back into a note. Every row carries where it came from (the note
and the exact offsets in it), who decided (a model by name, or `local` when
none was involved), when, and how sure, because a model that is wrong quietly
is worse than no model, and the only defence is that every derived thing can
be read, corrected, deleted and switched off.

**Why the derivation is local first and the model second.** The obvious
shape is to hand the note to a model and ask for a JSON list of claims and
questions. That shape has two faults this app cannot carry. The first is that
a model's paraphrase does not appear in the note, so the span that is supposed
to point at the source has to be re-found afterwards by string search, which
lands on the wrong sentence in any note that repeats itself and on nothing at
all when the model rewords. The second is that the notebook is offline-first:
a pipeline that derives nothing without a model would give a person with no
model a screen that is empty forever, and would be untestable against the fake
transport every provider test in this project runs on (CLAUDE.md section 4).

So the pass reads the note itself, splits it into sentences with their
offsets, and proposes candidates from the shape of each sentence. A model,
when one is running, is then asked to *narrow* that list, which is the half a
small local model is actually good at and the half where a wrong answer costs
a missing row rather than a fabricated one. `model` on the row names whoever
made the final call: the model when its reply was usable, `local` when it was
not asked or its reply could not be parsed. A row that says `local` is telling
the truth about itself, which is the whole contract.

**The lifecycle** lives on the row (see `DerivedFact` in `core/database.py`):
an edited row is never overwritten by a later run, a deleted row is a
tombstone rather than a `DELETE` so it is never re-derived, and a delete is
*also* written to the corrections store (`ai/learning.py`) because those are
two different jobs: the tombstone stops the re-derivation, and the correction
is what the loop learns from.

**The switches** are preferences, one per invention plus a master. Every
runner asks `runner_enabled()` before it does anything, and "off" means it
computes nothing and shows nothing while its existing rows are kept and inert.

**Nothing here imports `ai/learning.py`,** and the export that needs both
lives in `api/routes_learned.py` for that reason: `learning` asks this module
whether its runner is switched on, so an import the other way would close a
cycle (`tests/test_no_import_cycles.py` counts the statement wherever it
sits, which is the right rule: a function-level import is still a cycle, it
just fails later and further away).
