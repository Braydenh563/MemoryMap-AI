"""Topics inside an island, named (GRAPH_PLAN KG6, INBOX 528).

`paths.clusters` is connected components on purpose (its docstring says why:
exactly true, checkable by clicking). That decision stands. A topic is a
second, labelled layer over it: a judgement, said to be one, that a big
island is two or three subjects joined by a bridge.

**Detection: weighted label propagation, in id order.** Each note takes the
label its neighbours vote for most, a vote weighted by how strong the edge is
(`1 / Step.weight`, so a link counts four times a shared tag, as on a path)
times one plus the neighbours the two ends share. That second factor is what
stops a lone bridge pulling one subject into the next: an edge inside a
subject sits in triangles, a bridge does not. A note keeps its label on a tie
and otherwise the smallest label wins, so the answer is the same every time.
Cost is the edges times the rounds plus one set intersection per edge.

**Naming: what the topic shares more than the notebook does.** A term (a
tag, an entity, a title word) scores its share of the topic's notes times its
inverse document frequency over the notebook; a term every note has scores
nothing. Tags win ties over entities and entities over words, because a tag
is a name somebody chose. A topic nothing distinguishes is "Topic 3", never
an invented word, and a local model's summary is a separate, on-demand step.
