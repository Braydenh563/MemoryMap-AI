"""Page regions for the OCR workspace.

Asked for with three screenshots of Baidu's Unlimited-OCR: *"for the document
ocr I want smth like this"*, the page beside its regions, each region
separately readable, rather than one wall of text under the picture with no
way to tell which part of the page a line came from.

Tesseract is not installed in CI or in the sandbox this was written in, so
every test here drives `extract_regions` against a **fake** `pytesseract`
(the same fake-transport discipline the provider tests use). What that
proves is the grouping, the line breaks, the confidence filter and the
normalisation: not that Tesseract returns what this expects it to.
