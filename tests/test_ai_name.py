"""The notebook's AI is called Atlas, once, at the head of each prompt.

INBOX 225, decision taken: a name is a *theme*, not a persona. One constant
(`memorymap.ai.AI_NAME`) and one clause at the head of each prompt that
speaks as the app: the chat and Ask librarian, the agent, and the in-app
help chat. No backstory, no tone instructions, no other prompt growth.

The two things worth testing are the two things that go wrong with a name:
it appears twice (because two layers both prepend it, and the model is then
told who it is in a way no human writes), or it quietly costs context (the
persona is the half of the prompt nothing trims, `PROSE_BUDGET_CHARS`).

# The frontend half of INBOX 225. The decision was that the app names Atlas
# "everywhere the app speaks as it", and for a long time it mostly did not:
# 68 strings across eight files and 41 pieces of markup still said "the AI",
# which is the machinery, not the librarian. They were swept; this is what
# keeps them swept, because the next feature to ship a tooltip will otherwise
# write "the AI" again and nothing will notice.
#
# The rule has one shape and no exemption list: **copy the user reads does not
# call it "the AI"**. Where a line genuinely means the model or the runtime
# that powers it, it says so ("the local AI", "the model", "Ollama"), which
# reads better anyway. A hit here is fixed by rewording, never by adding the
# line to an allowance, which is how a lint stops meaning anything.

#: sweep and the rule above took the first. Eight pieces of copy still said
#: "the assistant" a week later, five of them the Tools and features
#: descriptions a person reads while learning what the app can do, which is
#: the worst place to be vague about who is doing the work.
#:
#: "The guide" is deliberately not here. That one is a surface with a name,
#: the Atlas guide, so a line about it is naming a thing rather than dodging
#: a name, and a lint that fired on it would be teaching people to write
#: around it.
