## Rules every agent carries (read CLAUDE.md section 2 and the `orient` skill first; these are the traps)

Setup (replace NAME and PORT with the brief's values; BRANCH is the integration branch the brief names):

    cd /home/user/MemoryMap-AI && git worktree add <scratchpad>/wt-NAME -b agent/NAME-<mmdd> BRANCH
    cd <scratchpad>/wt-NAME && git merge --no-edit -q BRANCH && ln -s /home/user/MemoryMap-AI/.venv .venv

- Python is `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python` (fastapi, pytest, ruff, numpy; no torch, no sentence-transformers). Commit with plain `git add <your paths>`, never `git add -A`; one commit per step; the orchestrator merges. Do NOT push, do not merge into the working branch, do not create plan documents; decisions in a plan's "Decisions made" are not remade.
- Commit trailers: the two lines the session supplies, last in every message. No model identifiers anywhere else.
- Before each commit: `bash scripts/gate.sh --staged` plus the targeted tests for files you touched, serially or `-n 2` at most. Never the full suite. `node --check frontend/js/FILE.js` after any JS edit.
- Serve (setsid, never plain `&`): `bash scratchpad/ui-sweeps/serve.sh PORT <datadir>`, or `setsid env PYTHONPATH=src MEMORYMAP_DATA_DIR=<datadir> .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn memorymap.api.app:create_app --factory --port PORT > <log> 2>&1 < /dev/null &`. Restart after any Python change. Never `pkill -f` a pattern in your own command line (exit 144): use `pgrep -f '[u]vicorn.*--port PORT' | xargs -r kill`, never on the same shell line as a start.
- Playwright: node scripts requiring `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright`, `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers`. `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/lib.js` `boot(opts)` RETURNS `{browser, ctx, page, OUT}`. Login: fill `#lock-password` with `testpassword123`, click `#lock-submit`; `THEME=dark` for dark. Never `waitUntil: "networkidle"` (use `domcontentloaded` plus `waitForTimeout`). Bash times out at 120 s: long runs go in the background with output to a file.
- Measure, do not look: `getComputedStyle`, `getBoundingClientRect`, `scrollHeight` vs `clientHeight`, `scratchpad/pngpixel.py`. Every claim is a number from a sweep you name. Reproduce a bug before theorising; say plainly what you could not verify.
- Copy: sentence case, no em-dashes (a lint fails), no exclamation marks, no "Oops". Inline `style=` is refused by the CSP: `el.style.x =` or a class. New UI from DESIGN.md's recipe index (`kebabMenu`, `.dock`, `data-help-for`, tokens); a need the index lacks gets its recipe and lint in the same commit. Help moves with the UI (standing order 13).
- Docs hygiene per commit: CHANGELOG.md line (and docs/CHANGELOG.md, same text); a fixed INBOX item gets `**Fixed <hash>.**` plus a measured line, then `python scratchpad/inbox_resolve.py <n>`; a finished plan step's Built block moves to HISTORY.md ("Moved from the plans"). Plan files have line caps (`tests/test_plan_hygiene.py`): move something out before raising one.
- Remaining-file rule: keep `docs/roadmap/agent-remaining/NAME-<mmdd>.md` current. After each commit append two lines (done: hash; next: item, file, line) and commit it with the step, so a run cut off at any moment resumes from `git log` plus that file. Before stopping, list what is left, one line each, with the owner's words and the file:line.
- Commit at least every 20 minutes (`WIP: <item>` if needed, squashed when the item lands). If you hit a rate limit, commit what is clean first.
- Token rule: no narration, no restating the brief; read only line ranges (`sed -n`, `grep -n`), never whole files over 300 lines; skip screenshots, numbers only.
- Final report, five lines and no more: status; commits (short hashes, one phrase each); numbers measured (before to after); not verified; found-not-fixed.
