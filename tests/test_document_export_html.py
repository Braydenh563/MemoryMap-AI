"""A document exported as HTML is one file that needs nothing else.

DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 7, and the decision in that plan's section 13: there is no
server-side markdown renderer in this app and the plan forbids adding one, so
the export is built in the browser from the pane that is already rendered. That
puts the thing most worth testing in a JavaScript file rather than behind an
endpoint, so this runs the document shell in node (the model lives between
`DOC-EXPORT-HTML-BEGIN` and `DOC-EXPORT-HTML-END` in documents.js, with no DOM
and no app globals in it) and reads the rest out of the source.

"Self-contained" is the whole promise: the file has to open on a machine with
no network, no MemoryMap and no account. Every assertion here is one way that
promise could quietly stop being true, and the one that matters most is the
cheapest to break: a stylesheet that grows a webfont `@import` is still a file
that looks right on the machine that made it.
