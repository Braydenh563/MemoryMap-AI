// vault-unlock.js: "Unlock private notes" and the guard that asks for it.
// Moved out of app.js on 2026-10-05 (the boot-script gzip budget): both run
// only after a person's click on a private note's chip or a private-note menu
// item, and `askPasswordPrompt`, `settleLockPrompt` and the `lockPrompt`
// state they borrow stay in app.js, where the lock screen needs them at
// boot. `LAZY_MODULES.vault` (app.js) stands in for both until this loads;
// `ensureVaultOpen`'s answer reaches its caller through the stand-in.

//: "Unlock private notes": the vault's key, for a session that started
//: without the password. The token is kept; only the key is loaded.
