// === EDITOR LAYER ===========================================================
// The "/" menu, the block frames it inserts, and the caret-anchored popup both
// it and the document's own [[ autocomplete are drawn with.
//
// Why this is a separate file rather than more of app.js: app.js is ~27k lines
// and ROADMAP Tier 4 makes the case, correctly, that a big-bang split must
// not share a diff with live edits to the same code. New code in a new file
// moves the line the right way without that risk, the same way graph.js and
// whiteboard.js already did. Loaded after app.js (see index.html), so every
// global it leans on, $, apiJson, allEntries, MD_ACTIONS, markDocDirty,
// renderDocPreview, BUILTIN_TEMPLATES, prefsCache, noteLabel, toast, is
// already defined.
//
// Two design decisions worth stating up front, because both were the cheap
// option *and* the correct one:
//
// 1. **One delegated listener, not one per textarea.** Every handler here is
//    bound once on `document` and dispatches on `event.target`. Binding
//    per-element would have meant a third `input` listener on `entry-content`
//    (it already legitimately has two, see ALLOWED_DOUBLES in
//    tests/test_frontend_handlers.py) and a fresh entry in that allow-list for
//    every surface added later. Delegation is how "one behaviour across many
//    inputs" is supposed to be written, and it means a new editor surface is
//    one line in EDITOR_SURFACES rather than a wiring change.
//
// 2. **Callouts are `> [!kind] Title`, not a custom fence.** That syntax
//    degrades to an ordinary blockquote in any other markdown reader, 
//    GitHub, Obsidian and Typora all already understand it. A custom fence
//    would render as literal junk the moment a note left this app, and
//    "your notes stay portable" is the whole premise of a local-first
//    notebook that stores plain markdown.

// Which textareas get the "/" menu, and what each one is allowed to do. The
// value is the context: an AI command that acts on a document has nowhere to
// run inside the capture box, so commands declare which contexts they suit
// and the menu filters rather than offering something that would no-op.
const EDITOR_SURFACES = {
  "entry-content": "note",
  //: The note *edit* form (notes-list.js's `renderEditForm`), which had none of this
  //: until now: the one editing surface in the app with no "/" menu, no
  //: toolbar and no selection bar. One id, because `editingId` allows exactly
  //: one open edit form at a time.
  "entry-edit-content": "note",
  "doc-content": "document",
  //: The chat composer. Asked for as part of "the chat interface needs
  //: bugfixing and more utility and features" -- "/" did nothing there, the
  //: one text box in the app where a slash menu is the *expected* affordance
  //: (every chat product the user compared this to has one). Its commands are
  //: chat's own: attach, web, plan, skills, mode. See `chatCommands`.
  "chat-input": "chat",
  //: The skill editor's steps box (DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 8c). The plan gives
  //: it the "/" menu and nothing else: it is a list of instructions, not note
  //: text, so it stays a plain textarea with no Live view and no engine, and
  //: `tests/test_note_surface.py`'s `NOT_NOTE_TEXT` says so. Its own context,
  //: because the note commands are all wrong here; see `skillCommands`.
  "skill-steps": "skill",
};

//: **What context an editing surface is.**
//:
//: `EDITOR_SURFACES` is an id-to-context table by construction, and for most
//: of this file's life the hard case was the document's Live view, which was
//: one textarea per paragraph with a generated id: gating on
//: `textarea.id in EDITOR_SURFACES` gave those blocks no "/" menu at all and
//: told them the document AI commands did not apply. Neither failure logged
//: or threw, which is this repo's "a policy silently refusing the work"
//: shape. DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 2 made Live and Source one editor, so the
//: generated ids are gone; the surface reports `doc-content` in every view.
//:
//: Returns null, not "note", for anything that is not an editing surface, so
//: callers can tell "not a surface" from "a note".
function editorSurfaceKind(box) {
  //: A surface, an element, or a node inside CodeMirror. The last of those is
  //: why this can no longer be a `instanceof HTMLTextAreaElement` check:
  //: CodeMirror's editable is a `div`, and gating on the textarea would have
  //: silently taken the "/" menu, the selection bar and the inline AI away
  //: from the document editor the moment the engine landed under it. Same

//: beside the adapter itself.
//:
//: **That file is not always there, and the guard below used to say it always
//: was.** Its own comment read "which cannot happen in the browser (the script
//: order is fixed)", and that stopped being true the moment documents.js
//: joined the Library's lazy bundle (`LAZY_MODULES`, app.js): index.html loads
//: app.js, editor.js, dashboard.js, settings.js and tour.js, and nothing else
//: until a tab asks for it. So on every fresh load, until the person happened
//: to open Library or Documents, `asSurface` was undefined, this returned
//: null, and `editorHandleInput` bailed on its first line. Measured on the
//: branch head, 2026-09-21: typing "/" in the note capture box gave 0 menu
//: rows and `editorMenuState.open === false`. The same for the note edit box,
//: the chat composer and the skill steps box, which is four of the five
//: surfaces the feature exists for. CLAUDE.md section 6's fourth shape, a
//: policy silently refusing the work, with a comment asserting it could not.
//:

//: * Ctrl+/ opens the menu with an empty query, from anywhere in one of these
//:   surfaces. A route that is not "type a character into your own text" also
//:   answers the person who wants the list without leaving a stray slash
//:   behind if they change their mind.
//: * Every one of these surfaces says so in its own placeholder, which is the
//:   one piece of copy that is visible exactly while the box is empty and
//:   gone the moment it is not. The capture box already taught `[[` there;

// Inline AI: the AI at the caret, not in a panel

//
// Asked for directly: *"the agent or ai needs to be more directly integrated
// into the documents."* Everything the document editor already had, AI edit,
// extract notes, rephrase, translate, check with AI, is a *panel*: you leave
// the text, open a side pane, ask, read, accept, come back. That is a fine
// place for "review this whole document" and the wrong place for "make this
// sentence shorter", which is the thing writers actually do fifty times an
// hour. Notion answers it with `/ai`, Cursor with Ctrl+K, Word with the
// rewrite popover; all three put the request *where the caret is* and put the
// result *into the text*, with one keystroke to keep it and one to undo it.
//
// Three deliberate constraints, each of which is why this is ~200 lines and
// not a second AI panel:
//
// 1. **No new endpoint.** `POST /documents/{id}/ai-edit` already takes an
//    instruction, an optional selection and a verb, already returns the
//    revised text without saving it, and already reports `ollama_running`
//    false with a message when the model is not there. A third code path to
//    the same model would be a third place for the offline message, the
//    thinking trace and the token budget to drift.
// 2. **Nothing is written until it is accepted, and "accepted" is the
//    default, not a modal.** The result goes straight into the text, selected,
//    with Keep / Try again / Undo underneath. Undo restores the exact prior
//    value and caret, because `before` is captured whole; a diff would be
//    prettier and would not survive the AI reflowing a paragraph.
// 3. **Document surfaces only.** The endpoint needs a document id, and the
//    capture box has none. The command and the shortcut both check, rather
//    than opening a bar that would fail on submit.
