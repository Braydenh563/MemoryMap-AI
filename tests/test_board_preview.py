"""A board's thumbnail: its shape, its branch colours, and the cache.

The picture on a Library card used to be a scatter of one-grey dots in a box
the shape of the card rather than the shape of the board, recomputed from
scratch on every visit. This file gates the three things that changed:

- **aspect**, so the miniature is letterboxed at the board's own ratio
  instead of stretched (`preview_aspect`, drawn by `mapPreview` in app.js);
- **colour**, so a map's thumbnail is the same picture as its canvas, branch
  by branch (`MAP_BRANCH_PALETTE`, Coggle's rule, which `wbMapColors`
  implements client-side);
- **the cache**, which is invisible in the response by construction: an
  identical answer is exactly what a cache is for, so the only way to assert
  it is the counter it keeps (`PREVIEW_CACHE_STATS`).

The staleness cases have their own tests here, because a preview cache that
serves the old picture is worse than no cache at all: the board a person is
looking at is the one they just changed.
