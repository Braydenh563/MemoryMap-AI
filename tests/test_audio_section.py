"""One Audio section (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 28.5 row 3): a meeting, a voice memo
and dictation are separate entries (the owner: "meeting notes should be
different ... from dictation"), each a palette row whose `about` is the catalogue's line, so each
is also a Quick access tile through `quickCatalogue`. Live captions is
Brief 82's palette act; the translator joins only when /voice/status lists
