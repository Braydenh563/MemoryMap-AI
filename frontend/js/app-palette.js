// content: that is Find anything's, INBOX 666), drawing the rows and the
// preview, and its keyboard. Moved out of
// settings-panes.js on 2026-10-05 (the boot-script gzip budget, ratchet in
// tests/test_static_compression.py): it opens only by a person's chord or a
// click on "Commands", so none of it is needed to draw the first screen.
// Loaded on first use by `LAZY_MODULES.appPalette` (app.js), whose stand-in
// for `openPalette` fetches this file and then calls the real one.
//
// **What stayed at boot, and why.** `paletteCommands` (the registry of rows),
// `catalogueRun`, `paletteKeys`, `paletteAbouts` and `paletteRowParts` are
// read synchronously by other surfaces that are not the palette: Quick access
// on the dashboard, Find anything's action rows, and the Tools and features
// dialog. A stand-in returns a promise, so those could not be lazy without
// making their callers asynchronous. `closePalette` and `renderPalette` are
// called from boot code only behind a "the palette is open" check, and only
// `openPalette` opens it, so the file is always in by then.
//
// The palette's three listeners (the input, its keys, the backdrop) were
// top-level wiring in settings-wiring.js; they are the last lines here, and
// run when the file loads, which is before `openPalette` shows the overlay.
