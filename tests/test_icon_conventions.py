"""Which overflow and menu icon goes where (INBOX 706).

The owner, 2026-10-06: "we have been using majority of meatball icons but I
think meatball, kebab, bento box icons and more etc are better for use in
various situations and uses". The platform conventions, taken:

- `⋯` (`ph-dots-three`, meatball) is an item's overflow in a horizontal row, a
  card or a bar of controls;
- `⋮` (`ph-dots-three-vertical`, kebab) is the overflow at the end of a row in
  a vertical list and in a narrow column (a rail's rows, a settings list);
- `⊞` (`ph-dots-nine`, bento) only switches between apps or spaces;
- `☰` (`ph-list`, hamburger) only opens navigation.

The app has no app switcher and no hamburger (navigation is the tab bar), so
the last two are listed here with an empty allowance: the day one is built it
joins the list on purpose. Rule and rows: DESIGN.md, "Overflow and menu icons".

# a sparkle in one menu and a wand in the next. One glyph per meaning now:
#
# - `ph-sparkle`: the AI does something for you (describe, read, ask, suggest,
#   draft, rewrite, file by meaning, the "AI off" mark).
# - `ph-strategy`: the agent, which plans and then acts in steps on your
#   behalf (Agent mode, the popup agent, Agent activity, its runs).
# - `ph-lightning`: Skills (left as it was).
# - `ph-magic-wand`: tidy or fix automatically, by rule, no model.
# - `ph-brain`: what it remembers about you.
# - `ph-asterisk`: a section break.
#
# Rule and rows: DESIGN.md, "AI and agent icons".
