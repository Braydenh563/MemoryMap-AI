"""The composer's wider vocabulary and its two voices (2026-10-06, the owner:
"expand the available sentence sections, grammar, lingo, understanding ...
more natural language and professional language options").

Every entry of `ai/composer_tables.py` is exercised: each phrase variant is
reached by some question, in the voice it belongs to; each synonym group
reads as a group; each wrapper, comparison form and lead-in does what it says;
each small-talk line follows the copy rules. The rule that facts stay quoted
from the notes is held by the eval's traceability check, run in both voices.
