"""A menu's trigger toggles (INBOX 681) and the Settings sidebar follows (INBOX 680).

The suite cannot see a browser, so these pin the two shapes the fixes took;
the behaviour itself is measured by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/toggles681.js` (every
trigger on every tab pressed twice, then Enter twice) and
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/settingsfollow680.js`.

**Why a press on the opener must not close the menu.** The outside-press closer
runs on `pointerdown`, before the opener's own `click`. A custom select's opener
sits in `.select-shell`, outside `.menu-wrap`, so the press closed the list and
the click that followed opened it again: the second press never shut it.
