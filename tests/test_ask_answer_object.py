"""Ask is Chat in single-turn mode (CHAT_PLAN.md Phase 3, decisions 8 and 11).

Three claims, none of which the DOM-blind suite could make before:

1. A follow-up asked from the Ask tab carries the answer above it. The chips
   under an answer call `askQuestion`, which sends `conversation` as history,
   so this is a claim about `/chat/stream`: the previous turn has to reach the
   model as its own messages, not be summarised into the system prompt or
   dropped. Asserted against the fake transport, which records every message
   list it was asked to answer.
2. The Ask tab renders the answer object rather than a second, thinner shape:
   `answerObject` is the one builder and its foot is drawn from the Chat tab's
   own three components.
3. When no model is connected every AI control stays visible and disabled with
   the same sentence on it, and Ask itself is never among them (decision 11:
   "Ask falls back to search results with passages; nothing is hidden").
