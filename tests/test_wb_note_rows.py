"""The owner, 2026-10-10: "text gets cut off on the note sidebar in the
whiteboard". The board sidebar's note row was the title and body run
together and line-clamped on the padded row itself; a clamp paints the next
line on into the bottom padding, so a sliced third line showed under every
long row (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/wbnoterows.js`: every row "clamp over
padding 8px" at 1440 and 1024 on base, 6/6 after). Now a name over one quiet
line, each ellipsised by the stylesheet."""
