"""A click on a graph note moves nothing (INBOX 587).

The owner, verbatim: "when I click nodes on the graph, it moves the graph
slightly??". d3-drag says `start` on the press, and the canvas renderer used
to pin the node, freeze the map and tell the worker a drag had begun right
there, which reheats the simulation: measured with
scratchpad/ui-sweeps/gl1005-graphclick.js on 142 notes, ten clicks moved other
notes by 15 to 65 screen px. The press now only remembers itself; the drag
begins past `GC_DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX`, and a press that never travels is a click
that tells the worker nothing (0 px after, the view unmoved).
