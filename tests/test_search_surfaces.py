"""Every search box asks the one engine (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN B3, OPEN.md
"search-one-surface"; search-boot-1005).

Before: the Notes list and the Library each had a second ranking path,
`GET /entries?q=...&semantic=true` (cosine only, notes only, a 25-note cap),
the Notes list's own parser did not know `kind:`, `has:` or `space:` (they
were read as plain words and matched nothing), and the palette matched the
loaded page of notes in the browser. `GET /search` is the engine every
content search now calls (the palette stopped searching content at all in
INBOX 666: it hands typed text to Find anything); each surface keeps its own look and its own result shape.

Two halves, because the suite cannot see the DOM: the backend half proves
the engine answers whatever the old path answered (same notes for a
fixture), and the frontend half is a lint that a surface *calls* `/search`
and no longer calls the old path.
