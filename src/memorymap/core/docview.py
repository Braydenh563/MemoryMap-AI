"""Reading an uploaded file's text, for the in-app viewer.

The ask was a viewer that opens "all document types", Word files, PDFs,
markdown, code, spreadsheets, CSV, plain text, the way an editor does, rather
than the app's current answer, which is that a file it did not convert on
import is a name in a list.

**The whole design follows from one decision: nothing new is ever served to
the browser inline.** `routes_files.media_file` already carries the reason in
its own comment: an inline PDF viewer is a script host, and the folder it
serves from is not guaranteed to contain only things this app wrote. A viewer
built by widening that endpoint's allowlist and letting the browser render
each new type would inherit that problem once per type added. So the viewer
never receives a file at all: it receives *text*, extracted here, on the
server, and renders it as text. A .docx that is really a zip bomb, a PDF with
an embedded script, an SVG with an onload handler, none of them get near the
renderer, because none of them are what is sent.

That also settles what "editing" can mean at this layer, and it is worth being
plain about rather than discovering later: **extraction is one-way.** Text
pulled out of a .docx is not a .docx, and writing it back would silently
destroy the formatting, images and structure of the original. So a viewed file
is read-only here, and the way to *edit* one is the path the app already has, 
`/import/document` turns it into notes, or its text goes into a document, 
both of which produce something this app owns and can save without lying about
what it is.

Three kinds of file, three ways in:

- **Text already** (.md, .txt, .csv, .json, code): read and decoded here.
  No dependency, always available.
- **A converted document** (.docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx): `entry/importer.py`'s
  markitdown, which the app can already install from Settings → Optional
  extras. Absent, this reports that rather than failing in a way that looks
  broken: the same contract `importer` itself keeps.
- **A scanned page with no text layer**: the vision model's transcription,
  `ai/vision_ocr.py`. Deliberately *not* Tesseract, by direct instruction:
  "I basically dont want to download tesseract and only want to use an ai
  vision learning and ocr model for images and scanned documents." Nothing
  here imports `core/ocr`.

**The third one used to be a dependency gap and no longer is.**
`ai/vision_ocr.py` reads an *image*, and a PDF page is not one until something
rasterises it; this app shipped no rasteriser, so the hook was wired and the
plug did not exist. `core/pdfpages.py` is now that plug, pypdfium2 behind the
`pdfpages` extra, ~16 MB, no system packages and no torch, measured at about
20 ms a page. It stays optional, and with it absent this still reaches the
"probably a scan" message rather than failing: the extras catalogue exists so
that a new dependency is a decision rather than a side effect.
