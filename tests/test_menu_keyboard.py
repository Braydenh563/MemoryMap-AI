"""Every menu keeps the keyboard contract (INBOX 403, the menu pass).

Measured by `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/menus.js` at 1440, before these held: every
enhanced select and every Library card menu opened with the focus on `body`,
select lists ignored ArrowDown, Escape in a Settings select closed Settings
and left the list floating, and the twenty-odd `details` dock menus and the
board's menus had no arrow keys at all. The sweep needs a browser; these are
the source-level ratchets on each cause, so a rewrite that drops one fails
here before anyone has to open a menu to find out.
