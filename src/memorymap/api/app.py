"""Build the FastAPI app: API routers + the static frontend.

No CORS middleware: the frontend is served from the same origin as the
API, so none is needed (plan §4). Note that an absent CORS policy is not
the same as a closed door, CORS governs whether a script may *read* a
reply, not whether the request is sent or acted on. What actually refuses
a request made by another site's page is the Origin check in
core/security.py, which runs alongside the CSP from the same module.

    **This is a desktop-app bug hiding in a header.** `StaticFiles` sends
    `last-modified` and an `etag` but no `Cache-Control` at all, and a response
    with neither `Cache-Control` nor `Expires` is one an HTTP cache may reuse
    *without asking*: for a heuristic fraction of its age (RFC 9111 §4.2.2).
    In a browser you press reload and never notice. The desktop shell has no
    reload, is a WebView2/WebKit instance with its own on-disk cache, and
    restarts the *process* without invalidating anything, so after an update
    the app can go on running the previous `app.js` indefinitely.

    That is precisely the shape of "the recycle bin's Empty now button is still
    broken": the fix for it (§35F's in-app confirm dialog) is in the file, and
    the flow was driven end to end in Chromium against this server, the dialog
    opens, the notes go, the server reports an empty bin. A user still seeing
    the old behaviour is running the old script.

    `no-cache` is not `no-store`: the file is still cached, and the conditional
    request still answers 304 from the etag above. All it removes is the
    guessing. Everything here is served from localhost, so the cost of a
    revalidation round-trip is not a real cost.

    **The `?v=<version>` stamp changes this calculus for exactly the URLs
    that carry it** (INBOX 47). `test_asset_cache_busting.py` already
    guarantees every local css/js reference in `index.html` is stamped with
    the current `__version__`, and a stamped URL is a *different* URL on
    every release: nothing is ever served stale from it, unlike the
    unstamped path above where staleness is only *revalidated* away. So a
    stamped request gets `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (the
    one-year-plus-immutable idiom browsers treat as "never revalidate")
    instead of `no-cache`, saving the round trip `no-cache` still pays.
    Unstamped requests (`/vendor/*`, deliberately unstamped per that same
    test, and any bare path) keep the `no-cache` behaviour above unchanged.

    **`index.html` itself is rewritten as it is served** (`served_index_html`):
    every `?v={__version__}` becomes `?v={__version__}-<hash of that file>`,
    so a file edited between two launches is a new URL the moment the page
    is next loaded (the desktop window's own cache, which the old per-launch
    `_BOOT_TOKEN` was there for, can never run yesterday's file), while an
    unchanged file keeps its URL and its cache across launches (audit
    2026-10-05, FE-02: the token had made every launch a cold load).

    (the space-delete `IntegrityError`, found in the §40 audit) fell through

    answers with a bare `text/plain` "Internal Server Error", not JSON, no

    left on. Two handlers close both gaps:

    - Every `HTTPException` (FastAPI's own class subclasses Starlette's, so

      added alongside its existing `detail`, `detail` is left exactly as

      "code": ...}`) to override any of the three explicitly; nothing in
      this codebase does yet, but nothing has to change here the day one
      does.
    - Anything else, a bug, not a deliberately raised HTTP error, becomes
      `500 {"detail": <a plain sentence>, "code": "internal", "ref": <uuid>}`.
      The traceback goes to the log keyed by that same `ref` (`logger.exception`,
      so it's a full traceback, not just the one-line summary `.warning` would
      give) and never reaches the response body: a stack trace in an HTTP
      response is a real information leak (paths, versions, sometimes a
      query with a value in it) and this app has no other layer that would

    # the headers below are stamped on the origin check's own 403 too.
    #
    # **Compression goes on FIRST, which means innermost, and the ordering is
    # load-bearing rather than stylistic.** Both middlewares below are
    # `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, and that base class re-wraps every response it
    # handles as a *streaming* response. Starlette's gzip only consults
    # `minimum_size` on a response it can measure, a stream has no length to
    # measure: so a gzip layer placed outside either of them compresses
    # everything regardless of size. Measured while adding this: with gzip
    # outermost, `GET /health` (70 bytes) and `GET /tags` (2 bytes) both came
    # back `content-encoding: gzip`, i.e. spending CPU to make small responses
    # larger, with `minimum_size` silently doing nothing. Innermost, gzip sits
    # against the routers and the static mount and sees real `Content-Length`
    # headers, so the threshold works.
    #
    # **Why compression matters here at all, given it is localhost.**
    # `app.js` is over a megabyte of unminified source and there is no bundler
    # and no minifier by design (CLAUDE.md: "no build step"), so this is the
    # only remaining lever on transfer size. It is not really about the wire:
    # the desktop shell is a WebView with its own cache, and `GET /entries`
    # hands back up to a thousand full note bodies per page.
    #
    # **Streaming was checked, not assumed**, this app has three streaming
    # endpoints (chat in `routes_chat`, the weekly digest in `routes_insights`,
    # the live log in `routes_settings`), and "gzip buffers a stream into
    # uselessness" is true of some implementations. Starlette's is not one:
    # `GZipResponder._compress_body` flushes with `Z_SYNC_FLUSH` on every chunk
    # carrying `more_body`, so each chunk still leaves the server as it is
    # produced. `text/event-stream` is already in Starlette's own exclusion
    # list; the two NDJSON streams are not, so they are named explicitly, 
    # which keeps those two responses byte-identical to what they were before
    # this existed.
    #
    # `compresslevel=6`, not the library default of 9: 9 costs meaningfully
    # more CPU for a few percent of size on text, and this is a single process
    # serving one user who is usually running a local model on the same machine.
    #
    # On BREACH: the attack needs compression *plus* a secret in the response
    # *plus* attacker-controlled reflection, and the last two legs are absent
    # here: the auth token travels in a header rather than a cookie (see this
