"""INBOX 272 part 1: "every failure names its way out."

The owner's words: make sure every failure and alternative is easily
noticeable and offered, not filed away in a different screen. Two named
examples, both already built (embedding model failure suggests
`nomic-embed-text`; DuckDuckGo rate-limiting tries SearXNG and suggests
installing it), plus every other point the 2026-09-21 survey found
(`docs/roadmap/WORLD_CLASS_PLAN.md` section 21).

This is a class of bug, and a class needs a registry, not a list of asserts
that each know one string. Two registries hold it:

- `memorymap.core.extras.EXTRAS`: every optional *package* the app can
  install for you, one allowlisted entry each (built before this session,
  reused rather than duplicated).
- `REMEDIES` below: every other failure with a known fix that is not "pip
  install something", switch a setting, pick a different model, wait and
  retry. Each entry names the file the failure is raised or reported in and
  a phrase that MUST appear in the message shown to the person; the phrase
  is the remedy, not the diagnosis, on purpose (CLAUDE.md's own reading of
  this report: "not prose telling the person to go somewhere else", a
  phrase like "Settings, Models" or "nomic-embed-text" is a place or a
  thing to click, not a shrug).

A failure this file does not know about is exactly what the next survey
should add a row for; this file's job is to keep the rows it already has
from rotting silently, the same shape as `test_offline_promise.py`'s count.
