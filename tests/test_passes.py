"""INBOX 713: every scheduled pass, with its schedule, Run now and Stop.

The owner: "for a bunch of the background processes like the night shift and
stuff, is it possible to manually run them as well as manually stop or cancel
them when they are running??" Decision taken: Background tasks lists every
scheduled pass with its schedule and last run, a Run now on each (through the
job pool, deduped), and a running pass's row carries Stop (`/tasks/cancel`),
which ends it at its next step.
