"""A relinked map topic is laid out as its new parent's child, and one Undo
takes it back (INBOX 410: "when I relink or newly link two mindmap nodes,
they clump together??").

`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/maprelink.js` is the measurement: a branch dropped on a
topic, and a loose topic joined by a line, on a tidied map and a Free one.
Before: on a Free map the dropped branch stayed on top of the topic it was
dropped on (7220px2 of overlap), and none of the four cases could be undone.
After: no overlap, the branch beside its new parent with its own child
beside it, and one Undo restores the parent and every place.

The suite cannot open a board, so this holds the shape the sweep measured:
the history has an entry that writes `parent_id` (the only one that can,
through `/move`), the transplant pushes exactly one entry, and a Free map
places the branch rather than leaving it where it landed.
