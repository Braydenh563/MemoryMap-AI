"""Importing an Obsidian-style vault keeps its shape.

Asked for directly: *"kortex and obsidian files and md file trees and being
able to link notes and obsidian md files and stuff is I think the largest gap
that is missing right now."*

The importer already read a whole vault before this, and threw two things
away: the folders, and the **filename**. The filename is the one that breaks
links: Obsidian's `[[wiki links]]` name the file, so a vault imported without
it arrives with every internal link pointing at nothing.
