"""The document editor's top dock (§ documents).

Reported with a screenshot: "fix/redesign the ui, layout, alignment, sizing,
and look of the documents top dock". What it showed was a single row holding
the title plus twelve controls of four different heights, wrapping onto three
lines with "⬇ PDF" and a bin left alone on the last of them.

Two causes, both invisible in the source and both found by measuring in a
browser:

1. The dock carried `.doc-toolbar`, the *formatting* toolbar's class, so
   `.doc-toolbar button` restyled its `.ghost.small` buttons as 2rem glyph
   buttons while leaving the `<select>` and the segmented control alone.
2. The first fix used `height: var(--control-h)`, and `--control-h` is scoped
   to `.library-toolbar`/`.library-controls`. Undefined here, so the rule was
   invalid and did nothing, silently. Measured: 45 / 43 / 37 / 27 / 22 / 18px
   across six controls that are meant to be one height.

These are lints: nothing here can see a rendered page. They pin the two causes
so neither can come back unnoticed.
