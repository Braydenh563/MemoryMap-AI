"""The notebook on a time axis (roadmap §10B).

Asked for repeatedly, and with more shape each time: *"I want a note timeline
where I can see notes visually by what time they were made. Maybe I can even
group them by events or related places etc."* The axis is time; the **bands**
are what makes it a map of what happened rather than a sorted list.

Two decisions worth knowing:

**A note can appear at a date it was not written on.** §10A resolved the
relative time in note text, "the deadline is next Friday" knows which Friday
- so a note plots at what it is *about* when it says something, and at when it
was written otherwise. That is the whole reason the timeline is more than
`ORDER BY created_at`, and every placed note says which of the two it used so
the view can be honest about it.

**Bands come from what is already stored**, category, tag, or a note thread
(`Entry.parent_id`, §87.6): rather than from an `events` table that does not
exist yet. Grouping by event is still the goal (§10), and this is the shape
it will slot into: one more `group` value.
