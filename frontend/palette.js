// palette.js: the popup agent over every tab (Ctrl+K), its twelve starters,
// its turns, its source previews and its conversation menu (split out of
// app.js, the sixth boot-time file after editor.js, dashboard.js,
// timeline.js and settings.js).
//
// Why now: `tests/test_static_compression.py` bounds the gzipped app.js, and
// on 2026-09-24 it went red again at 752,031 bytes after the catalogue's deep
// links landed. The test's own comment says the answer is the next surface
// out of app.js, not a fourth number, so this is that surface. Moved
// verbatim: every line below this header is the text app.js had between
// "// --- Global Command Palette (Ctrl+K) ---" and "// --- spaces".
//
// Loaded after timeline.js and before settings.js (see index.html). Every
// top-level line here reads only what app.js, editor.js, dashboard.js and
// timeline.js have already defined (`$`, `kebabMenu` and the rest) or this
// file's own names. The reverse direction was checked by grepping every name
// this file declares against every other frontend file: app.js calls
// `toggleAgentPalette`, `cmdPaletteOverlay` and `cmdPaletteResults` only
// inside functions and listener closures (the shortcuts table's `askAgent`,
// the status-bar agent button, the catalogue's "Popup agent" row, the
// tab-jump chord), and settings.js reads `agentCurrentTab` behind a `typeof`
// guard, so nothing reaches into this file at parse time.

// --- Global Command Palette (Ctrl+K) ---

//: **The popup agent's twelve starters** (CHAT_PLAN.md decision 9). Four was
//: the count before, and the owner's report was not that they were wrong but
//: that they were all there was: "just defaults to one of the sentence
//: starters", because the things actually wanted of an agent that floats over
//: every tab (make a note of this, remind me, find, summarise the open note,
//: what changed today) were not offered and typing them out is slower than
//: doing the job by hand.
//:
//: Grouped by verb, and each one is a verb with a slot rather than a finished
//: sentence: CHAT_PLAN's research section, from Raycast, where a starter that
//: reads "Remind me to ___" is picked far more often than the same action
//: written as a question. A starter whose text ends in a space is a stem: it
//: is put in the box with the caret after it and waits. One that does not is
//: complete and runs on the press.

//: (`CMD_NOTE_REF` matches the "68" in "note #68"), and a model that writes
//: the wrong id produces a link that goes somewhere the answer never meant.
//: Nothing here can tell a right id from a wrong one: only the person
//: reading the sentence knows which note they were promised.
//:
//: So the tooltip carries the note's own opening words, labelled the same
//: way the source chips below the answer are labelled and from the same
//: retrieved entry. When the model gets it right the tooltip agrees with
//: the sentence; when it gets it wrong the disagreement is visible before
//: the click rather than after it. `entry` is optional because a caller
//: without one is still better off with a working link than none.
//: **The link says which note it opens, in the sentence, before it is

//:
//: Reported with two screenshots: an answer that read "You only have one note
//: (note #68) in your notebook, and its content is simply '# bubble tea'",
//: with both chips labelled "bubble tea", and clicking "note #68" opened a
//: Shakespeare sonnet parody. Traced: the destination is not wrong.
//: `flashEntry` selects `li[data-id="${id}"]`, so the button opens exactly the
//: id the text names, and the run-of-ids walk below only ever links an id this
//: turn actually retrieved. What went wrong is upstream of the app: the model
//: wrote an id that belonged to a different note than the one its own sentence
//: was describing, and the app then dressed that number up as a citation, which
//: is what made a model's mistake read as the app sending you somewhere at
//: random.
//:
//: A tooltip was the first answer and it is not enough: you have to hover a
//: thing you have no reason to distrust. So the note's own opening words go
//: *in* the link, beside the model's own wording, which is left exactly as it
//: was written. When the model is right the link reads "note #68 · bubble tea"
//: and confirms itself; when it is wrong it reads "note #68 · Act I, Scene I"
//: and the mismatch is visible in the sentence without clicking anything. The
//: app cannot make a small local model cite correctly, and it can stop
//: repeating the claim as though it had checked it.
