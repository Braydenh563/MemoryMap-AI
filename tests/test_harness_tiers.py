"""H3: behaviour tiers by model size (AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM, "Harness
robustness", phase H3).

Before: one boolean (`is_small_model`, under 8B) decided the toolbox, the
schema length, the round cap and the forced first call, and a 1.5B and a 7B
got the same treatment. Measured on Qwen2.5-1.5B: one "Make a note" turn ran
948 s to the 2,048-token reply cap, writing the note out in prose, and made no
call. Now one table (`agent.SIZE_TIERS`) holds every size decision, a small
model's tool rounds have a reply cap of their own, and prompt bookkeeping the
model echoes ("similarity 0.54", "note id 3") comes off the answer.
