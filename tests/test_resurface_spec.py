"""Resurfacing (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I4): the spec. Strict-xfail until built.

Three cards a day: notes that are fading (old, unlinked, unopened) and close
to what the person is doing now. The fading score is computed nightly into
`note_scores`; the request-time step multiplies by cosine to a context
vector and drops anything marked "never again" (a correction, I7).
