"""A document's frontmatter, read for the list.

DOCUMENTS_PLAN Phase 3 item 4's second clause: "searchable from the Library's
filter". The Library reads its documents list to the end already, so the
filtering itself is client-side and costs no round trip; what it could not do
by itself is *see* the properties, because `_summary()` in
`api/routes_documents.py` deliberately sends a preview rather than a
document's content (a document runs to thousands of words). This module is the
one thing the list needed: a small, read-only parse of the frontmatter block,
whose result rides along on the row.

**Read-only, and that is the whole safety story.** The editable model, the one
that turns a keystroke in the properties panel into a list of `{from, to,
insert}` edits covering nothing but the value's own span, is in
`frontend/documents.js` between `DOC-FRONTMATTER-BEGIN` and
`DOC-FRONTMATTER-END`, and `tests/test_doc_frontmatter.py` runs it in node. It
is not duplicated here, and it must not be: two implementations of a *writer*
are two ways to reformat somebody's file. This one only ever reads, so the
worst it can be is incomplete, and an incomplete read shows a filter one key
short rather than a document one paragraph short.

The subset understood is the same one that model understands, and the same one
the editors in the plan's competitor table actually write: `---` on line 1,
`key: value` until the closing `---`, values that are scalars (quoted or not),
inline lists (`[a, b]`) or block lists (`- a` on the lines under the key).
Anything else is skipped rather than guessed at.
