"""AGENT_SKILLS_REFORM Phase D, judged by a real model rather than by a fake.

CLAUDE.md section 4 is the reason this file exists and the reason it is shaped
the way it is. Every other provider test in this project runs against a fake
transport, so the one thing none of them can say is how a real small model
behaves when the runner re-prompts it, resumes it, or hands it a reworded step.
Phase D's acceptance line is exactly that claim:

    A five-step built-in skill run against a small local model completes every
    step or reports precisely which contract failed: no step marked done
    without its contract met.

**How this stays out of everybody's way.** `scratchpad/llama-dev.sh serve`
prints two environment variables, MEMORYMAP_EVALS_URL and
MEMORYMAP_EVALS_MODEL. They are read here at import, while the module is being
collected, and without them every eval in it is skipped, so CI, the ordinary
suite and `scripts/gate.sh --full` never need a model, a binary or a network.
Nothing here imports the script or shells out to it: the seam is those two
strings and nothing else, and the last test in this file is what keeps it that
way. To run these:

    bash scratchpad/llama-dev.sh serve 8092      # prints the two exports
    export MEMORYMAP_EVALS_URL=... MEMORYMAP_EVALS_MODEL=...
    .venv/bin/python -m pytest -m evals tests/

**A set variable with nothing behind it is a failure, not a skip.** Setting
these says "I have a model and I want it judged". If the server is then not
answering, skipping would report green for work nobody did, which is the exact
dishonesty the rest of this file is written against. It fails, and names the
command that starts one.

**What a real model can and cannot make these tests assert.** The assertions
here are the runner's guarantees, which hold whatever the model says: a step is
never ticked without its contract, a stalled step carries one sentence naming
the contract it missed, a resume starts where it was asked to, a single-step
re-run runs one step and pauses. Whether a 1.5B model *succeeds* at the
notebook work is not a guarantee and is not asserted: that number belongs in a
report, not in a pass or fail.
