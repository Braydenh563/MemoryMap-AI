"""A model per feature, layered over the roles that already exist.

Asked for directly: *"allow the user to alter the model they use for that
specific feature if they wish such as for the write with ai area, the chat tab
and document ai assistant. allow these to be easily individually altered and
reset and for there to be a mass reset for all individually altered ai model
preferences."*

The point of the feature is that two surfaces really do run on two different
models, so the assertions below are about **the model that reached the
provider**, not about a setting that round-tripped through the API. A
preference that saves and never reaches `chat()` is the "feature that never ran
once" of CLAUDE.md section 6, and it would pass a round-trip test perfectly.

The other rule with a test of its own is that an unset feature stores nothing
(decision 5): if it stored the resolved name, changing the chat model in
Settings would leave every unset feature behind on the old one, silently, and
nobody would connect the two events.
