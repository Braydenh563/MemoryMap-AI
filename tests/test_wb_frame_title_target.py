"""A frame's title keeps a target-sized hit area at any zoom (harness-wb-1004
item 1).

The title is board text, so at a phone's fitted zoom (k 0.24) it was about
7px tall and a press-drag aimed at it landed on the board and moved nothing.
Its box now grows upward to `--target-min` on screen, which needs the inverse
zoom published to it: a rule that reads `--wb-inv-zoom` without its selector
in `WB_INV_ZOOM_GRIPS` stays at the root's 1 (test_wb_navigator_cost.py keeps
the two lists equal; this keeps the title in both). Measured in a browser by
scratchpad/ui-sweeps/left1005-frametitle.js: 44px at k 0.21 on a phone, and
the frame, an inner frame and its sticky move by one delta with nothing, the
frame, everything or the inner pair selected.
