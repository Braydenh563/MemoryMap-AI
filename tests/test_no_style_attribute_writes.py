"""No script writes a `style` attribute: the page's CSP refuses it.

`style-src 'self'` has no 'unsafe-inline', so `el.setAttribute("style", ...)`
and d3's `.attr("style", ...)` are refused, and each refusal is a console
error. The CSSOM (`el.style.x = ...`, `el.style.setProperty`, `cssText`) is
not an inline style to the CSP and works. Found on the graph's SVG export
(`graphInlineComputedStyle`), which wrote one per element of the clone: 6,278
refusals for one export of the 417-note fixture, while the picture came out
right, because the attribute was kept (`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphexportcsp.js`,
0 after). It writes SVG presentation attributes now. CLAUDE.md section 6,
shape 4, is the same rule for markup.
