"""The companion moves on its own time and rides with the panel it is on.

INBOX 426, the owner: "they still telleport and move suddenly as well and it
is jarring"; "atlas needs to move and work on its own time not based off how
fast the user is switching tabs or scrolling. if it is sitting on a pannel and
I scroll or that panel moves it might fall or move with the panel"; "it keeps
disappearing and reappearing on different parts of the page as I scroll";
"when I press the option to stay in the same spot across pages ... it still
moves"; "the companion just went off the screen and I cant get it back now";
"the right click companion dropdown menu doesnt appear where the companion
is"; "I changed my name but the companion which was me didnt update".

The motion itself is measured in a browser by
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/companionscroll.js` (a per-frame trace over a scroll:
glued within 2px, no frame jump past 45px beyond its panel's own, never
below full opacity) and `companionbeats.js` (fast tab switching, pinning,
resize, the menu's place, call back, no frame loop when idle). These tests
pin the wiring that makes those numbers true, so a later edit cannot quietly
put the old behaviour back.
