"""A chat turn is saved once, however fast the model answers.

Found taking the README's Chat shot (INBOX 431 (g)): against a model that
streamed a whole answer in about a second, the agent round's checkpoint
(`checkpointTurn`, chat-attach.js) was still creating the conversation when
the turn finished, so the end-of-turn save saw no id and created a second
one. The list showed the same question twice, 43ms apart, one of them a
half-turn. The end save now waits for a checkpoint in flight.
