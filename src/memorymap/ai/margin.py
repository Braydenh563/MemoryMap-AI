"""The margin reader: a second reader in the editor, from your own notes
(WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I2; 18, H8).

Every editor's AI writes *for* the person. This one reads *with* them,
against what they wrote before: given the paragraph under the caret, at most
three cards, each typed and each pinned to a sentence in another note:

- ``repeats``: the paragraph says again what a note already says;
- ``contradicts``: the same thing with a different number or a "not" (no
  model needed), or what the model judges a disagreement;
- ``answers``: the paragraph answers an open question the night shift found
  (`DerivedFact` kind ``question``);
- ``date``: a time phrase in the paragraph, read by the same date reader
  that fills a note's dates, offered as a reminder;
- ``related``: the closest note by words and meaning, when nothing sharper
  holds.

**Computed, never stored.** Nothing here writes: the cards are a reading,
and a link or a reminder is made only when the person presses its button,
through the routes that already make them.

**Fast without a model.** The candidates come from the keyword index and,
when the embedding backend is up, the meaning matrix with each long note's
best paragraph (row 6's chunk vectors), so the answer is a few milliseconds
of lookups. `judge=True` with a model up adds one short call per candidate
(at most three), which the editor asks for as a second request after the
fast one has drawn, so a slow model never holds the margin empty.
