"""The model bench: which installed model is best on *this* notebook
(WORLD_CLASS_PLAN 15, I8; 18, H3).

Every local-AI app tells its owner to "try a model". This one measures each
installed model against the owner's own notes, on their own machine, and
shows the failures, so the recommendation can be checked rather than trusted.
Nothing leaves the computer: the only requests are to the model server the
person already configured.

**The held-out set needs no model to build.** `build_set` samples notes the
person filed themselves (a category other than Uncategorised), and from each
picks one sentence with two distinctive words, words that occur in that note
and in no other sampled note. Three tasks follow from one item:

- *filing*: the note, cold, with the notebook's categories offered, through
  the same system prompt and prompt builder the janitor uses, so the bench
  scores the filing a model would actually do here; right when it names the
  note's own category;
- *citation*: three notes, numbered, the right one among two others, and a
  question naming the two words; right when the answer cites the right
  number. The answer is also timed and its tokens counted;
- *tools*: one tool offered (`find_note`), and an ask to look the first word
  up; right when the model calls that tool with that word.

**Deterministic.** The sample is seeded by the notebook's own ids, so two
runs over an unchanged notebook score the same items and differ only where
the model itself differs (the plan's gate: within two points on a rerun).

**Bounded.** A wall-clock budget and a stop event are checked between every
task, so a slow model or an impatient person never leaves a run that cannot
end; the report says which ended it (`stopped`: "stopped", "budget" or "").
