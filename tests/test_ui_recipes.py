"""New UI goes through DESIGN.md's recipe index, and drift is a ratchet.

The owner: "all the ui issues and stuff with popup menus, ui not matching
and more happen when new features are added or changed because you don't
follow design.md". Two things a diff cannot show and a review misses:

1. A glass surface that is not on the `[data-glass="off"]` list stays
   glassy with the setting off, and blurs at a radius of its own. Every
   selector that declares a backdrop-filter must be on that list or in the
   families DESIGN.md names.
2. A menu built by hand instead of `kebabMenu()` positions itself, clamps
   itself and closes itself differently from every other menu in the app,
   and that is where "the menu is crushed" reports come from. The count of
   hand-built `role="menu"` elements per file may only fall.

Both are ratchets: the known drift is frozen here so the lint starts green;
a fix removes an entry, a new offender fails the build.
