// onboarding.js: the first-run welcome card (five slides' worth of text, the
// setup check with its two one-click offers, and the card's own buttons).
// Moved out of settings-wiring.js on 2026-10-05 (the boot-script gzip budget,
// ratchet in tests/test_static_compression.py): the card opens once per
// notebook, or when someone presses "Replay the welcome", so nothing here is
// needed to draw the first screen. Loaded on first use by
// `LAZY_MODULES.onboarding` (app.js), whose stand-in for `openOnboarding`
// fetches this file and then calls the real one. `maybeShowOnboarding` stays
// in settings-wiring.js, because it is what decides whether to open the card
// at all and it is a dozen lines. The three buttons are wired here, at the
// bottom: they are only on screen while the card is, and the card only opens
// through `openOnboarding`, so the wiring has always run by the time they can
// be pressed.
