"""GRAPH_PLAN Phase 5, "positions on a saved view" (INBOX 275's neighbour
row, "Placed from INBOX, 2026-09-21").

A saved view used to restore the layout, the colour rule, the filters, the
groups and the zoom transform, but not where the unpinned notes sat, so a
force-layout view reopened as a fresh solution of the same forces rather
than the picture that was saved. Measured live with
`scratchpad/ui-sweeps/graphviewpos.js` (needs a running app; this file is
the static guard the Python suite can run on its own).

The fix is the one on record: `graphCaptureView` (frontend/graph.js) stores
each visible node's x/y, and `renderGraphCanvas` (frontend/graph-canvas.js,
the default renderer; the SVG one is a dev-only fallback slated for
deletion) seeds the simulation with them. The decision made alongside it,
2026-09-21: a restored arrangement holds, it does not re-settle, and only
reheats (holding the saved notes fixed while it does) when a note has no
saved position (added since the view was saved). This is a shape check, not
a behaviour one: it cannot run the simulation, so a change that keeps every
string here but flips the actual logic (e.g. hands the "no unplaced" branch
alpha 1) would still pass. The sweep is what catches that.
