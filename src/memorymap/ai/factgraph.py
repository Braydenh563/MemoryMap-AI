"""The facts under a note's sentences, typed by rule (CHAT_PLAN Phase 6,
decision 30): the layer the composer measures, times and relates notes with.

A fact is a span of the note's own text and what kind of thing it says: an
event ("met Sam"), a quantity ("5 km"), money ("$1,200"), a date ("on
Friday", resolved against the day the note was written), a duration, an
entity (a capitalised name), a list or checklist item, a decision, a
preference, a plan, a question, a link, a quotation, a topic. Every fact
carries its offsets, so whatever is said from it can be traced back to the
characters it came from, and its *mode*: asserted, negated, hypothetical
("maybe", "might"), conditional ("if"), question, or quoted (inside quotation
marks, or after "said", "wrote", "according to"). Someone else's words are
never read as the person's own: no event, plan, decision or preference is
taken from inside a quotation, and the realiser never shifts its pronouns.

Rules only: tables and patterns, no model, no network. Built lazily per note
and cached per revision (the note's id, its edit time and a hash of its
text), so a notebook read twice is read once. Polarity by lexicon, in the
specification, is not built: no feature asked for uses it (decision 30's own
condition), and the contrast insight reads preferences, which are typed here.
