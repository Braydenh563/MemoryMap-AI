"""The entity layer's own routes (GRAPH_PLAN KG5, INBOX 528).

An entity (a person, place, project, organisation or thing a model found
named in the notes) had a name and its mentions, and nowhere to be looked at:
it was a node on the graph that could not be opened. This is its page (where
it is said, in the sentence that says it; what it is named with; the dates
its notes resolve), its list, and the hand edits a model's guesses need:
a kind, a rename, other names, a merge.

A private note lends nothing here: not a mention, not a sentence, not a date,
not a co-mention.
