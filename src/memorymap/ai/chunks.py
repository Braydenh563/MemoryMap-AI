"""A note's paragraphs as character spans (WORLD_CLASS_PLAN section 14 item 3).

Its own module, not inside `embeddings`: the composer cites a quote by its
paragraph (`grounding.paragraph_ordinal`) and answers with no model, and
importing `embeddings` for this brought the model manager, the database models
and SQLAlchemy with it, 0.6 to 1.8 s on the first answer (engine probe P8).
`embeddings` re-exports every name here, so the stored chunk rows and the
citations still read one split.
