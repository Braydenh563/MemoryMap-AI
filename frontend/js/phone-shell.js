// A tiny generative emblem next to the title: a ring of linked nodes (the
// MemoryMap motif), coloured in the accent, seeded randomly each visit so
// it's one-of-a-kind, with a slow rotation.
// One identity per visit: every emblem in the app draws from the same seed, so
// the logo in the top bar, on the lock screen and in the empty states is
// recognisably the *same* mark rather than five unrelated doodles.

//: at boot (`EMBLEM_SLOTS`) and five of them live inside a panel that is
//: `display: none` almost all the time: the lock screen, the onboarding card,
//: the chat and graph empty states, the About dialog. Each one is a p5
//: instance with its own 24fps draw loop, and p5 keeps that loop running
//: whether or not its canvas has a box: measured on an idle whiteboard, six
//: canvases alive, one visible, and 5.0 `requestAnimationFrame` requests per
//: displayed frame.
//:
//: This is the same shape as the hidden tab that kept two clocks ticking, and
//: it is *not* a retreat from "whenever the generated p5.js node graph logo
//: shows, make sure it is never static and always rotating": the loop is
//: stopped only while the mark is not shown, and started again the moment it
//: is. An `IntersectionObserver` is the right instrument because a
//: `display: none` element never intersects anything, so "is this on screen"
//: needs no polling and no per-panel wiring.
//:
//: Not a claim about the whiteboard's drag lag. That report is still
//: unattributed (`agent-remaining/mindmap.md`); this is work the app was
//: doing for nothing, found while profiling it.

// --- the tab bar docks to the bottom on a phone -------------------------------
// UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md Phase 9, band 4.
//
// The stylesheet does the whole of the bottom bar's appearance. This function
// exists for one reason, and it is a reason that cost a measurement to find:
// **`position: fixed` does not reach the viewport from inside the header.**
// `header#top-bar` carries `backdrop-filter`, and a filtered element becomes
// the containing block for every fixed descendant, so the bar pinned itself
// to the bottom of the *header* instead. Measured at 390: `position: fixed`,
// `bottom: 0` applied, and the bar sitting at y=51 on an 844px screen.
//
// So the node moves. Out of the header and onto the body while the phone band
// holds, and back into the header on the way out, in its original place. The
// same element throughout, so every listener, the roving tabindex and the ids
// survive; this is the move `foldDockArrange` makes for the same reason.
//
// `.tabs-wrapped` comes off with it. `syncTabOverflowFade` gives the strip a
// row of its own inside the header when the seven tabs will not fit beside
// the wordmark, and with the strip no longer in the header that class was
// still on, holding the top bar at two rows: 110px at 390 against 58px at
// 599, for a header with identical contents.

// --- a sheet, the phone's own dialog ------------------------------------------
// DESIGN.md's recipe index, "A sheet". UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md Phase 11.
//
// The app had two sheets before this one and no recipe for either: the three
// sidebars become edge sheets below 600 (`.sidebar-sheet-open`) and the graph's
// dock becomes `.graph-popup-sheet`, each with its own closing behaviour, its
// own idea of what the scrim is and its own bottom inset. A third built the
// same way is how the first two came to disagree, so this is the shared one and
// the lint in `tests/test_ui_recipes.py` says a fourth may not be hand-built.
//
// It is the `.modal-overlay` + `.card.modal-card` dialog the whole app already
// uses, with one class added on each: a dialog that comes from the bottom edge
// rather than the middle of the window is the same object at a different size,
// and building it as one keeps the scrim, the z-index tier, the backdrop press
// and the Escape handling identical to every other dialog here. What the sheet
// classes add is where it sits, how wide it is and the safe-area inset under
// its last row.
//
// `build` fills the card; the caller gets the `close` it can call from a row.
// Focus goes to the first thing in the sheet on open and back to whatever had
// it on close, which for the More sheet is the button that opened it.
//: `variant` is one word, added as `sheet-<variant>` to both the overlay and
//: the card, for a sheet that has to sit somewhere other than across the foot
//: of the window. One user so far, Atlas (INBOX 224), which is a chat and
//: therefore a column: the full-width sheet gave it 1356px lines at 1440. It

// --- the settings section jump list -------------------------------------------
// UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md Phase 9, band 4.
//
// **This one already existed, and that was not the same as it being good
// enough.** Below 640 the Settings dialog already collapses to a single
// column with the seventeen sections laid out as a strip that scrolls
// sideways, and the comment on that rule explains why a vertical list was
// worse: stacked, the nav's natural height is about 700px and the content
// pane was left twenty pixels tall.
//
// The strip fixed that and left its own problem, which is only visible if you
// measure it: at 390 the strip needs **2337px of scroll inside 308px**. Seven
// and a half screen widths of chips, with the group headings hidden because
// they do not work horizontally, to reach "About". Every section is reachable
// and none of them is findable.
//
// A native `<select>` with an `<optgroup>` per heading is the whole answer on
// a phone: it opens the platform's own picker, shows all seventeen at once
// under the three headings the desktop nav uses, is keyboard and screen
// reader accessible for free, and adds no custom popup to a dialog that is
// already a popup. It is built from the nav rather than declared beside it,
// so a section added to the markup appears here with nothing to remember.

// --- the floating primary action ----------------------------------------------
// UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md Phase 9, band 4.
//
// Three docks have a single filled action and the phone band floats it
// bottom-right, in the thumb's arc above the tab bar. The stylesheet does the
// whole appearance; this exists for the same reason `dockTabBar` does, and it
// was found the same way.
//
// **`position: fixed` does not reach the viewport from inside a card.** Every
// `.card` in this app carries `backdrop-filter` (that is what makes it glass),
// and a filtered element is the containing block for its fixed descendants. So
// the button pinned itself to the bottom right of the *card* it lives in,
// which on Library is the card holding the dock, at the top of the page.
// `touch.js` caught it as two controls that cannot be tapped: `#library-refresh`
// and the dock's overflow menu, both covered by "New document" sitting on top
// of them at y=201.
//
// The button moves to its own `.tab-page`, which has no filter and is a direct
// child of the body, so `fixed` means the window again. That element is also
// the one that gets hidden when its tab is not showing, which is what keeps a
// floating action from appearing over a tab it has nothing to do with; parking
// it on the body would have needed a second mechanism to answer that.

// --- the dock's arrange zone folds into its own overflow menu ------------------
// UI_MODERNISATION_PLAN.md Phase 9, bands 2 and 3.
//
// Measured with `scratchpad/ui-sweeps/` at four widths, before this existed:
// the Notes and Graph docks are 36px at 1440 and **80px at 1024 and 820** and
// 172px at 390. They wrap. That is the whole of the owner's complaint about
// this app having no responsive design: nothing was designed for a tablet,
// the row simply ran out of width and folded onto a second and a fourth line
// until the chrome ate the page.
//
// The grammar Phase 8 settled already says what to drop first. Identity,
// search and the one primary action are what a narrow surface must keep;
// order and view are settings you change occasionally, and the dock already
// owns a place for a control used occasionally, its `...` menu. So below
// 1100 the `.dock-arrange` zone moves into that menu, and above 1100 it moves
// back out.
//
// **Moved, not cloned, and never hidden.** Two rules this phase is explicitly
// held to, and both have bitten this codebase before. Cloning a control
// leaves two elements with the same id and one of them wired to nothing
// (`initNotesFiltersSheet` carries the same note). And `display: none` on a
// sort select is a control that no longer exists on a tablet, which is not a
// responsive design, it is a smaller app. Moving the same nodes keeps every
// listener, every id and every enhanced `<select>` shell intact, and the
// controls stay one tap away behind a button that is always in the row.

// write already captured the call that reverses it, so the pass can be read
// back and undone one item at a time. `changeRow` is the same renderer the
// chat uses for a skill's result, so Undo here goes through exactly the path
// the chat's own Undo buttons do.

// There is no Tags / Recycle bin / Activity shortcut in the notes sidebar, and

// handlers left behind (which is how `test_frontend_ids` found three ids that
// nothing defined), briefly restored during the §40 audit on the assumption
// the removal had been accidental, and then removed again, deliberately this
// time, because the owner asked for it.
//
// The reasoning is the Library's own (§36G): the bin, the activity log and the
// tag list are all "show me the things of this sort", which is what the
// Library is, and it reaches each of them through its own filter chips. A
// second door in a sidebar that is meant to be a category list is exactly the
// "too much in one place, clashing with the text beside it" this app has been
// asked to stop doing.
